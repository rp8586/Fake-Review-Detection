144,145,__label1__,2,N,Electronics,B0007N55NM,Sony MDR-XD100 Stereo Headphones (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Didn't meet up to my expectations,"I bought these things after reading allot of good reviews. But sadly these didn't meet up to my expectations. The bass is very lacking and the sound is pretty low quality. I am glad I bought them thought to get a personal experience of them, although they are stylish and fold nice that's pretty much all there is good to say about these. So I returned them before the return policy ran out, and moved to another Brand. After trying a few models Skull candy makes, I decided they were not for me."
150,151,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B008DS0XYE,Beats Solo HD On-Ear Headphone (White) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Paying for name,These are good headphones but you are paying more for the name on the side.  I actually tend to use ear buds more than these.  So quality wise they are good but can find better or same quality for less money.
187,188,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B004JRYLG4,JVC HAS160B FLATS Lightweight Headband Headphones (Black),What a great deal!,The headset has worked great in my household. I have left them on my head and realized they were working clear as a bell downstairs when I retrieved something to drink. What clarity they have! Tune them in and you're all set. I've even laid down with them and they don't turn off like others have. All the controls are on the side of the ear piece and don't get in the way of lying on side. What a great deal!

I'm thinking of picking up a http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B004I8WHC4  in this case spend the extra money and get something nicer.  I hope this review was helpful! -J
491,492,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B004FJV8EE,Sewell BlastIR SW-29311 Infrared (IR) Remote Control Receiver Kit (Black),Great Deal,"This repeater was super easy to install...just place the receiver, place the repeaters on your devices, and plug all into the base. Total installation time was less than 10 minutes, and now my cable box and DVD player are hidden, no need to open the cabinet doors anymore."
519,520,__label1__,4,Y,Electronics,B002TZBW74,Ckitze Flat Europe/Asia to USA Plug Adapter,Working affordable Europe to USA adapter,"there is nothing more to say except that it is a cheap working  plug adapter, I would only hope that this one would last longer than my previous one"
528,529,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B00C402ZYS,"Bluetooth 5.25"" Indoor/Outdoor Weatherproof Patio Speakers (White- pair)-by Sound Appeal",OK for the money,These speakers are fairly basic but sound decent compared to other Bluetooth speakers. I would recommend these.
578,579,__label1__,3,N,Electronics,B004444O5A,"AKG Q460 Mini On Ear Headphones, Quincy Jones Signature Line",earphone,I also believe the Q's will be more durable. The plastic headband on the Solo's breaks WAY TO EASY! Stay away from the hype and get this better product. My only complaint is the length of the cords.
581,582,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B00BCRL770,Directv Dtv Wall Mount for C31 Client Receiver Mounting Bracket,It works,"Had four DirecTV devices, needed to expand to five, this worked right out of the box with no issues whatsoever."
631,632,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B000OL3QTW,Sony SA-W2500 Performance Line 100 Watt Subwoofer (Old Version),A good product,"My son asked for this subwoofer on his birthday, so I bought it for him. He seems to like it so far, so that’s money well spent. I just don’t understand why he wanted it in the first place though. I don’t even know what it does."
632,633,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B002HK5AW4,CAT5e RJ45 PATCH ETHERNET NETWORK CABLE 50 FT WHITE,nice,It was nice to find something cheap at a fast ship place. The quality of product and receipt of merchandise is ok as wished. I should have paid attention before and ordered these cable.
667,668,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B00CAAJDP6,Sony STR-DN1040 7.2-Channel Network A/V Receiver (Built-in Wi-fi & Bluetooth),Comes with issues,"This baby is pretty good once you get it running, but it does come with a few issues. It took a while to setup and get used to, but I can say that about a lot of products, so whatever. Still, I hate having to be patient since I have no patience."
696,697,__label1__,3,N,Electronics,B0011TS8LM,"JLab Audio J4 Heavy Bass, Rugged Metal In-Ear Headphone, GUARANTEED FOR LIFE - Obsidian Black",sounds quality is very low,Perfect that you can listen to music on this Bluetooth but what's the point if the sounds quality is very low. There is no volume adjustment when listening to the person on the other end. I didn't return it because of the shipping and handling cost. I kept it as a standby Bluetooth in my car.
704,705,__label1__,1,N,Electronics,B008CS5ZRU,Beats Studio Over-Ear Headphone (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),WASTE OF MONEY!!! Low quality and not comfortable AT ALL!!!,"When I purchased this headset, I had been looking for a quality pair for a long time. I had tried time and time again hoping for something that sounded great and was comfortable on my head.<br /><br />Not only was this headset extremely uncomfortable, but the sound quality was horrible. After only a week, one side stopped working and I had to hit it to try to get it to work again. This was absolutely NOT what I expected after looking at the other good reviews.<br /><br />I searched again, asked around and finally found a headset that works now, and I love it! It has been about 2 months and it still works great. I can go hours at a time without them bugging me and the sound quality is AMAZING!<br /><br />If you need a QUALITY headset, go here ------&#62; http://amzn.to/1nsrbPn<br /><br />I promise, they are well worth what they cost. You cannot beat quality!!!"
705,706,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B000H12VI6,JVC 900MHZ Wireless Headphones - Black (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Quality is very good,I bought as gift for my son. He says he loves his new headphones. The quality is very good. His only complaint is that they are a little bit of an awkward fit. I offered to send them back but he said absolutely not. Thinking of getting myself a pair.

There is no way to get decent volume without distortion."
758,759,__label1__,4,Y,Electronics,B00ODC9HJG,"Sentey LS-4201 Amplitude X360 Black In-Ear Headphones with In-Line Microphone Controller for Apple, iPhone, iPad, iPod, Smartphone, Samsung Galaxy, 15mm Drivers, 3.5 mm Connector.",Nice headsets with this price,"These headphones are awesome.Really light as a feather and a durable cable.Sound quality is great as well but only thing that i had problems with was the rubber head of the headset,which has trouble fitting my ear but i hope I will fix it in no time!"

It works as advertised and won't disappoint unless you're expecting it to do something that it wasn't even designed to do.
819,820,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B00FA4UC2M,Grain Audio PWS.01 Packable Encased Bluetooth Wireless Speaker System with 8 Hour Rechargeable Battery (Walnut),best quality,"good sound best quality , nice celerity, nice looking body ,,its a super Awesome product, best thing is loud voice"
871,872,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B00EGJMHEI,iFinity Wireless Audio Transmitter and Receiver Bundle - Black,Excellent wireless range,"I am streaming music from my basement to several rooms in my house. I have been looking for a solution that allows me to distribute music wirelessly. Some of the systems that I found from Logitech and Sonos were out of my budget. Also, Logitech stopped making their product. So I gave this transmitter a try. I am very pleased with the wireless range. I was a bit concerned given the small size of the transmitter unit. However, this set performed quite well in every scenario that I tried. I have located the receiver in all of my rooms and I am getting clean reception. What I like is that I can get addition receivers to place in multiple rooms. I don't know how many transmitters can be used at the same time but apparently they use a smart pairing feature that allows several transmitters to run within the same home. I don't really need the iPod cradle but this is a nice extra feature."

When I buy my hdmi wire I'm careful to inspect the cord and make sure the grade quality is standard.

957,958,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B0035FJVHA,iHome  iP37BB 30-Pin iPod/iPhone Portable Speaker Case,Amusing,"Strangers in remote places always look at this device with awe whenever I bring it with me since they never really expect a speaker in the middle of nowhere. I have to say that the sound could be better, but what can you expect?"
966,967,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B001GTTEBK,"Cheetah Mounts APTMSB Flat Screen TV Wall Mount Bracket Designed for 32""-55"" Plasma LED LCD TV (Actually Fits 20-55"" TVs) Includes Free 10' Braided High Speed HDMI Cable With Ethernet",Happy to purchase,"Nice range of motion--horizontal arc, foreword angle, TV rotation. Firm on the wall--three huge lag bolts that go into a wall stud, which you should be able to hit given range of motion."
1017,1018,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B008AX7RFU,"MiiKey MiiSport Black Wireless Bluetooth 4.0  Headphone with Microphone ,Built-in MP3 player,Supports Micro SD ,Sweat-proof and HD Audio",Average product no bad not so good,"This was a gift for my daughter and so far they are meeting her needs. She is a college student and needed something that wouldn't break and was ""LOUD"". I checked them out when I visited her and they are pretty good for the price can't complain."
1023,1024,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B00B7D4CS0,Philips DS3205 Charging Speaker Dock for iPhone 5/iPod with Lightning Dock,son loved it,I ought this for my son and he loved it. It's perfect for his not-too-big room and the sound quality is great. I can hear some decent bass too. Guess it's a steal!
1029,1030,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B00HVVONP4,Apple EarPods 827 In-Ear Stereo Headphones with Remote and Mic - White,worth for money,"I am using this headphone for a month,it delivers good clarity.The bass quality is above average and treble dominates but it gives the quality sound worth for its price.so it is worth buying."
1031,1032,__label1__,1,N,Electronics,B00I9HC50O,Grace Digital GDI-BTAR512 100-Watt Digital Integrated Stereo Amplifier with Built-In AptX Bluetooth Wireless Receiver (Black),Annoying hissing,This amplifier seemed like the perfect solution for my problem. I wanted an integrated solution to stream music from my iPhone to a pair of floor-standing speakers wirelessly. My speakers do not have wireless and I did not like having a separate wireless receiver and amplifier. Since my phone supports Bluetooth I gave this amp a try.<br /><br />It worked as long as the distance between my phone and speakers was within 20 feet before cutting out. The build quality seems a bit cheap but for the price I guess that is what you get.<br /><br />The real bummer however was the fact that there is a constant hiss in the audio. I think this hiss is generated by the amplifier itself. If I turn down the volume the hiss goes down. If I turn it up the hiss comes back. This is very annoying since I otherwise would have liked this product. Unfortunately this constant white noise is driving me crazy. I have since returned this unit and purchased a similar product from another vendor.
1066,1067,__label1__,2,N,Electronics,B0049MM3GY,Mach Speed 8 GB Trio-T4300HD MP3 Media Player (Silver/Black),bad picture quality,I bought this for my adult daughter and was going to load it up with pictures and music. The music part was great but the display for the pictures was so bad that it was verually a waist of time. Looking at the engine of my Victory was just a blob of crome and black. No detail at all. Couldn't see any individual cooling fins.

Even if the cord works, it does not allow you to connect a computer to a TV.  Just don't work, from Video camera out put RCA to the Monitor."

The instructions are not clear and concise. I was not able to hang my TV with this product because of the unclear instructions. I would not recommend buying this product.
1127,1128,__label1__,3,N,Electronics,B000YN01X4,"Insten Universal World Wide Travel Charger Adapter Plug, White",adaptor,"The usage of the adapter is very straightforward: pick out the appropriate plug you need for your current location on the front of the adapter, then plug your unit into the correct jack on the back. It is a two way Adapter, allowing you to adapt in either direction. (From any country's standard to any other, for the standards supported by the unit.)"

Not real attractive, bulky. Disappointed in the product. I'm just glad I didn't spend the money."
1187,1188,__label1__,1,N,Electronics,B007X26T3A,Wolverine WIOS2 Wireless Indoor-Outdoor Stereo Speakers - Water Resistant - Black (Twin Speakers),Poor sound,The wireless connection of these speakers works pretty well but the sound quality is the big disappointment. Very tinny sound with lack of base. If I crank up the volume the plastic enclosure starts vibrating causing discoloration of the sound. I am now using regular bookshelf speakers instead.
1195,1196,__label1__,3,N,Electronics,B003C1AO2I,Sony HT-CT150 3D Sound Bar System (Discontinued by Manufacturer),OK for speaker / sub,"Got this for my birthday and overall sound quality id rate it about average.  It does a bit better than my 50"" lg that its hooked up to, but nothing earth shattering.<br /><br />Took a bit of playing around with the settings to get the sound right, and the sub provides a good bass if you turn it up.  If space is tight I would recommend this setup, but otherwise I would go for a better surround sound package."
1206,1207,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B0038W0K2K,MEE audio Sport-Fi M6 Noise Isolating In-Ear Headphones with Memory Wire (Black),Overall it's Good!,"I have used this over 3 months now, it's working good and durable. The sound is awesome with a Bombastic Bass!"
1208,1209,__label1__,2,N,Electronics,B001EYU3L2,Sony MDRNC7/BLK Noise Canceling On-Ear headphones (Black),comfortable but sound's horrible,The quality is very poor. It's sturdy and comfortable but the sound is horrible. I bought these for my girlfriend for birthday so she could edit with and I didn't want to believe her when she said the didn't sound right. As soon as I hear the first song on them I said they were going back.
1219,1220,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B00LG71NZ2,Apple iPod Touch 16 GB Blue (5th Generation) MP3 Player,Best iPhone to date,"I've had the phone almost 6 months now, and use it regularly every day, from gaming to messaging, email to music. Great battery life. Awesome display. Perfect weight. Perfect size. Incredibly thin. Awesome camera. It's a design compromise that I can live with, though."

There's really nothing more to ask for than that.
1229,1230,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B007R6HUEE,JAM Classic Bluetooth Wireless Speaker (Blueberry) HX-P230BL,Great sound quality,"Amazed by the performance. The sounds is fantastic and the set-up was remarkably easy. Sound is crisp clear and good bass. Despite being very pricey for a speaker of this size, it has proven to be a worthwhile purchase in the few days that I have had it. However, it lacks the surround sound feel. If you are looking for that, I will recommend the following as an alternative<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CO07C5U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00CO07C5U&linkCode=as2&tag=derdigki-20"

Make sure the kid you are buying them for wants them because they look really stink-in' cool!
1293,1294,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B00A0C5FDA,Lutema Wavecube Aqua Portable Digital Speaker W/fm Radio - Red,Great classroom speaker.,I purchased one for my classroom to play music for my students. They enjoyed the speaker so much that I ended up purchasing more to raffle off for good behavior and good grades.

Don't expect high-quality stereo sound; it sounds like a portable record player. It is what I had expected when ordering and am satisfied with the purchase."

It didn't sound any better than the speakers in my HTC One, but the light made it a fun desk toy.  The problem is that it only worked for a week prior to breaking.  The manufacturer won't honor their warranty, saying that the retailer I bought it from wasn't &#34;authorized&#34; by them to sell it in their store."
1380,1381,__label1__,3,N,Electronics,B0001FTVEK,Sennheiser RS120 On-Ear Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Dock,user friendly,"I found it to be very user friendly, i just hate the fact that the very next day i ordered then they went on sale for half the price....that was very disappointing."

It does not have any ticks or issues that I have yet to notice. I am very pleased with the performance.

This will not replace your surround sound system. The wattage rating and speaker size reinforces this point. That being said, the quality of the tower is up to par.<br /><br />* Quality enclosure<br />* No assembly required<br />* iPod mates to tower<br />* Remote mates to iPod<br />* Secure line Jacks<br />* MP3 Aux-in Jack<br />* FM radio with 20 preset<br />* Composite video output<br /><br />These are all good working features and those without functional glitches.<br /><br />An area that could be improved:<br /><br />AM stations seem to be non-existent. Perhaps FM stations are only received.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />The tower is priced well and the quality of the audio is very good. We purchased the tower for our sons room and in that space the tower works well."
1505,1506,__label1__,2,N,Electronics,B00008VF5W,Coby CX49 Personal AM/FM Stereo Cassette Player (Discontinued by manufacturer),cheaply made,This product is so cheaply made it is unbelievable. The sound quality is terrible. When you insert a cassette be careful not to bend the pin that sticks out inside of the unit that fasten in the cassette. The radio will not even begin to pick up weak stations. My wife wants to keep it because it is portable.
1519,1520,__label1__,4,Y,Electronics,B008BY4GO8,iFinity Wireless Indoor/Outdoor Speaker - Bundle 1 Black,I love it. It's just what they say it is,"It is great outside by the pool. If forget to bring it in, it's ok cause it will not hurt the speaker."

My first scan I got 32 channels. After a bit if adjustment, I got 40 channels. Great picture, great sound.I would have given it a five but I took off a star because the mounting bracket was not what was pictured. The bracket I got is very flimsy."

1586,1587,__label1__,1,N,Electronics,B00C2M72A0,Sabrent Weather Resistant 900MHz Wireless Indoor/Outdoor 150 Ft Stereo Speaker System with Remote and Dual Power Transmitter (SP-NELO),Static,I didn't realize that these speakers work at 900 MHz until I opened the box. Unfortunately there is quite a lot of static on both speakers. The amount of static changes depending on where I position the speakers. I guess there are just too many gadgets out there these days that use this frequency band which makes it hard for these speakers to compete. I am going to have to get these exchanged for a model that is more robust.
1587,1588,__label1__,4,N,Electronics,B003O6PXS6,"NAXA Electronics Portable MP3/CD Player with Text Display, AM/FM Stereo, USB/SD/MMC Inputs",portable player,this player saved our family from going crazy . we moved into a new house and had to wait 10 days for cable. this was on 24-7 during that time. did a great job..sound is great .

It is not a good buy at all.
1649,1650,__label1__,2,N,Electronics,B000VEP3XO,Rocketfish Universal Wireless Rear Speaker Kit RF-WHTIB-A,Hissing,There is a constant hissing noise overlapping the audio. I tried everything from changing the volume on the wireless unit and my HT receiver but the hissing persists. If the audio is fairly loud the hissing is less noticeable. However it is pretty obvious during silent passages. Definitely not as good as hard wiring the speakers.

Every car has a car charger and every room in the house has an AC charger. As everyone knows, no matter what you do to try and conserve battery life on the iPhone, you inevitably run out of power. Ever since I got the QCell, that problem no longer exists. The QCell is small enough to just throw in your backpack, briefcase, purse, etc and know that you are covered. The charge time to get the phone back to a ""worry-free"" level is quite impressive. Those marathon conference calls that seem to occur when you are away from a power source used to be an issue. The long airline flights where you are playing a game on the iPhone, and even though you are in airplane mode, the battery still doesn't last. Well, with the QCell, both those problems is solved. The led comes in handy too when you are in a bind. The laser pointer is nice too, but I don't think I will ever use it. There are plenty of miniscule laser pointers out there, that are more comfortable and convenient to use."

I used my son's iPhone 5 and had the exact same problem.<br /><br />I visited the Apple store (where they sell this item) and asked if they knew of any problems. Their reply - - ""We haven't heard of any problems and haven't had any returns"". Really? I find that hard to believe.<br /><br />I returned the Pill and purchased the JamBox and have NEVER had a problem with the pairing. Sure, the sound was better from the Beats Pill and the look is definitely more appealing.

You can do much better as far as sound quality for far less money. They have decent bass, stylish looks, fair build quality, but simply are not the headphones for serious listeners.<br />They performed pretty good on hip-hop, but if you are into anything else, and expect $200 worth of sound, these fall way short. In fact for half the money, you can get a set of Sennheisers that out perform these hands down.<br />In my opinion they are simply a name brand fashion accessory and not a performance headphone. Guess it boils down to:<br /><br />Are you looking for great sounding headphones? - these are not it. They get points for style, and bass performance is solid.<br />Mids and upper frequencies are muddy and lack luster. They simply fall flat for most music.<br /><br />Are you looking for a fashion accessory and don't really care much for sound over looks and branding? These are your headphones. They do look nice, are fairly comfortable for semi-long wear. They have a solid ( but boomy ) bass response, but really.... At $200, they are just over priced bling.<br /><br />To each their own, I think if people were honest, they couldn't possibly justify the price to performance, had they actually listened to some good headphones. Or perhaps they just need to attempt a justification for spending $200 on these, but bottom line is: if you want performance, sound quality, build quality, and maybey not so much the looks and the branding. You can do much much better in a set of Grados or Sennheisers. If you just want ridiculous bass you can get the Klipsch for $50 less and they sound just as good, if not better. I can't tell ya what you like, but I know good sound... And you may have noticed I didn't mention several other over priced branded headphones that I seen others mention. Basically for all the same reasons... You can do a lot better for a lot less money. But even if you decided to buy a $200-$300 set of Grados or Sennheisers, you are gonna get what you paid for, and they will completely destroy the branded price equivalent.<br /><br />That's my opinion : )"

They replaced Energizers (model NH15BP4) that couldn't hold a charge for more than a day (which is standard for Energizer rechargeables... just read the reviews).<br /><br />However, these Amazon batteries caused our Canon SX110 digital camera to malfunction. The lens would not autofocus. I searched online and read digital cameras can be picky about batteries. We tried other batteries in the camera later that day and it worked perfectly. I checked the Amazon batteries on a La Crosse Technology BC-700, which I highly recommend, and they were fine. I'm chalking it up to the Canon is just picky. Aside from that one hiccup, these batteries are amazing when it comes to holding a charge.<br /><br />I'm using them primarily in my Uniden scanner and they work great.<br /><br />I'll try to update this review in the future."

Possibly comparable to these Sennheisers Earbuds http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B001EZYMF4  As far as THESE headphones. They are a great set of headphones overall and will not disappoint you. http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00T56GFTA  Pros + Easily pairs up with any device. I was able to pair it with both my computer (mac air) and my iphone. Once pairing is done with all the devices, you can connect to two of them simultaneously. Although, there were certain issues when I was in a microsoft lync meeting. The microphone was connected in mono mode and hence people hear muffled voices from me.  + Looks sturdy, although it is made of plastic. It fits well for someone with a smaller head as it fits really tight so that it doesn't slip from your head (happens when you are doing a workout or so enthusiastically shaking your head for your favorite song). Prolonged usage caused a little soreness over the ears. The head band is adjustable.  + Most important - the sound quality. The first impression was not great and I decided to actually return the product. But, I experimented with more good quality audio with deep bass, techno, melody, etc... The SOUND IS NOT THAT GREAT. Don't expect bass from this headphone. But it is decent enough with the sound quality that you won't repent your purchase.  + Volume - This is seriously loud even with the lowest volume level in your device as well as the headphones. BASS very low.  + Functionality with phone - It works well both with the mic and the sound. Problem occurs only when you are connected in mono mode and not stereo mode (I use this terminology as shown in my mac air for this headphone). While in mono mode, people hear your muffled voice and you hear back nothing. If you are connecting to more than two devices and one of them is your phone, connect to your phone first and then to the other device next.  + Charge - This headphone retains pretty good charge. Its been 4 days since I charged it and I use it at least for 3 hrs everyday. The iphone also shows how much charge is left on the headphones.  Cons - My biggest con with this headphone is - not only I can hear the music but also everyone sitting around me, even if they are at a distance of 15 feet. There are no sound proof systems with this headphone and thus there is lot of leakage in the audio. So it seriously becomes a speaker instead of a headphone at volumes just at two bars.  Overall, this is a good headphone if you are not looking for something too good for music listening. You will not regret your purchase and will be happy you checked out http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00T56GFTA  I hope this review was helpful!"

Now the mount is heavy and big itself so I guess that can be a draw back, but it has to be if your trying to get it to hold screens of this size and weight. It was pretty easy to install with a friend I would not recommend doing it alone it is a two man job. Once the we had it up and got my heavy tv on it everything held and didn't budge. When it came to moving it one of the joints were a little stiff just enough to bug me, I was able to adjust the swivel tension screw and fixed it with ease. This mount moves with ease as I change up the direction my display is facing all depends on where I am sitting or at in my room. But I can see the screen from a prefect angle wherever I wanted to be. I really have nothing bad to say about this mount just something's I pointed out. like I said you will need someone to help you because its heavy but other than that its smooth sailing. make sure your screwed into your studs!

That's surely amazing and I haven't seen a feature like this. The other party just does not know I am on a headset and they are impressed every time I tell them. The range is also very good I can go around 30 feet and no loss of signal and quality.

But it is decent enough with the sound quality that you won't repent your purchase.  + Volume - This is seriously loud even with the lowest volume level in your device as well as the headphones. BASS very low.  + Functionality with phone - It works well both with the mic and the sound. Problem occurs only when you are connected in mono mode andnot stereo mode (I use this terminology as shown in my mac air for this headphone). While in mono mode, people hear your muffled voice and you hear back nothing. If you are connecting to more than two devices and one of them is your phone, connect to your phone first and then to the other device next.  + Charge - This headphone retains pretty good charge. Its been 4 days since I charged it and I use it at least for 3 hrs everyday. The iphone also shows how much charge is left on the headphones.  Overall, this is a good headphone if you are not looking for something too good for music listening. You will not regret your purchase and will be happy you checked out http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00UN5Z1BK"

They are a great set of headphones overall and will not disappoint you. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00V3L7WME  Cons - My biggest con with this headphone is - not only I can hear the music but also everyone sitting around me, even if they are at a distance of 15 feet. There are no sound proof systems with this headphone and thus there is lot of leakage in the audio. So it seriously becomes a speaker instead of a headphone at volumes just at two bars.  Pros + Looks sturdy, although it is made of plastic. It fits well for someone with a smaller head as it fits really tight so that it doesn't slip from your head (happens when you are doing a workout or so enthusiastically shaking your head for your favorite song). Prolonged usage caused a little soreness over the ears. The head band is adjustable.  + Easily pairs up with any device. I was able to pair it with both my computer (mac air) and my iphone. Once pairing is done with all the devices, you can connect to two of them simultaneously. Although, there were certain issues when I was in a microsoft lync meeting.

My first try was with Sony MDRZX600. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B007BY3POQ  I went to Bestbuy set on getting the Sony V55's. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B007BY3PNW Luckily, they head these right next to the V55's. After spending about 15 minutes listening to both, I thought the low's on this one sounded better and the headband had more padding.  They sounded very warm and were great for high's and mids, but the lows were lacking and you needed to listen on full volume for them to sound good. I decided to return them and try the Sennheiser 439 but the volume was too low and that was a deal breaker. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B005N8W1TM  I brought these home http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00S749IQ8 plugged them into my Nexus 7 and I couldn't believe how great they sounded.

In summary, Pros: + Great frequency range with deep, rich bass (5 Hz to to 22,000 Hz) + Very comfortable earpads (more comfy than other more expensive headphones I've tried) + Does not make my ears sweat, even in the summer-- a very pleasant surprise + Vibrant color options/ slick design + Wires are tangle resistant (although they are &#34;spaghetti&#34; style for those who care) + Lightweight, and fairly comfortable even with long use + Aesthetically pleasing + Price is decent + Great sound quality for price  Cons: - Plastic build- not cheap feeling but worth a mention - Sound isolation is average, adequate for cafes/ dorm rooms but unsuitable for city/airplane use unless you really crank the volume - Seems to be some some sound leakage at high volumes - Noise reduction, while good for supra-aural headphones, isn't as effective as its circum-aural competitors. This wasn't a big deal to me, but itmay be for some people. - Cord is a bit short (1.2 meters) for some applications (In my case, use with a desktop computer)   All in all I now recommend these to all my friends http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00S749IQ8"

6798,6799,__label1__,5,Y,Electronics,B00SD67XEO,BESTOPE(TM) Mini DisplayPort Thunderbolt to HDMI/DVI/VGA Adapter 3 in 1 DP Adapter Cable for Apple MacBook Pro MacBook Air,This is a great addition to my Surface Pro 3.,"It is light, well built, and although the plastic seems like it might be slightly more fragile than the Apple equivalents, it is more than sturdy enough and feels quite solid. The screw downs are all recessed (a nice touch) and the connections are all gold plated (at least they look gold plated). The cable length is just right, and the connector itself fits perfectly. The cable itself is heavily molded and doesn't seem as fragile as other similar dongles, so it should stand up to years of abuse. The device is relatively small but obviously the box end is larger than a single DVI or VGA adapter, and measures about twice the length of an Apple DVI dongle and about 70-80% the length of most of my 3rd party dongles. On the other hand, it is thinner than my other dongles which helps in the bag. Considering you'd need three separate adapters, you could be reducing your carry weight by over 4-fold."

Sound Really Packs a Punch,"I have had many bluetooth speakers. My husband goes through several a year because he uses them so frequently. So, when we were offered the opportunity to try this Bluetooth Speaker with LCD Display I was excited - but I was not sure that it would be any different from the others we have used.<br /><br />I took the speaker out of the box immediately after receiving it - and I have to say that I was very impressed with its overall look. It's very modern, sleek and sophisticated looking. Plus, the weird waterproof velvety texture is fun and feels nice. I love the bright blue LCD screen - it makes it super easy to see what channel you are on - or which controls you are using.<br /><br />I also loved that unlike so many other devices of this variety - this bluetooth speaker has it's own charger - it does NOT run off of batteries! It has a USB style charger that plugs into the wall or your computer. It charges quickly and the charge lasts a long time. No more having to buy batteries every week. You will get back the cost of this speaker just in the lack of having to buy batteries.<br /><br />The speaker is really simple to use - my phone found it easily - and, after the first time - they are now friends! My phone and the speaker find each other instantly - no lag time. The sound quality is amazing. This is probably one of the larger waterproof shower style speakers that I have owned - and it definitely has a lot of oomph to it. The speaker itself has its own volume and also responds to the media level on your phone. That can take a little getting used to - but it's pretty simple. Overall, I am in love with this speaker. We use it every day - it suctions to a wide variety of surfaces 0 si we can use it all around the house. I really wish it came in more bright, fun colors - but other than that I am super satisfied with my purchase. I would definitely buy this again."

6934,6935,__label1__,5,Y,Electronics,B008BNO40U,Wireless Speaker Kit with 2 Wireless Amplifiers,Perfect for rear home theater speakers,"I have a fairly high-end home theater system. Unfortunately my living room has hardwood flooring and therefore it is fairly difficult to install speaker wires without creating a fair amount of clutter. I looked at a few wireless speaker kits. I definitely want good quality and thus didn't opt for an entry-level model. However, I didn't want to fork out $500 for such a kit either and thus opted for the Amphony kit which is slightly less than $200.<br /><br />At that price point I was somewhat concerned that the build quality of the kit would not meet my expectations. After receiving and unpacking the kit, I was pleasantly surprised though. While both the transmitter and wireless amplifier units are packaged in a plastic enclosure, they are by no means cheaply built. They have a comfortable feel to them. The two wireless amplifiers are extremely light and quite small. I don't mind that since I have just enough space under my rear speakers to slide them in. I like the fact that unlike other wireless kits you get 2 wireless amps. The only drawback is that you have to set the volume on each amp before using the kit. If you have a fairly modern home theater receiver like I do, however, you just have to set the volume to approximately what you need and let the auto calibration routine of the home theater receiver do the fine tuning. So overall the installation is pretty straightforward.<br /><br />The sound itself is crystal clear - no hissing or crackling whatsoever. I figure that this kit would also be ideal to put some speakers in other rooms of my house but I haven't done any extensive range testing. For what it is worth this kit works extremely well in my living room. Oh, did I mention that even though I have a fair amount of other wireless gear in the house, I haven't had any issues with interference. I guess this is because this kit works at a different frequency. I really like this kit."

Most Bluetooth headsets I own are much smaller and go inside the ears. They aren't as comfortable as these are.  The padding is great for long listening. You won't ever get that uncomfortable or sweaty ears situation.<br />I also appreciate the fact that each time I have gone well over 10 hours without having to recharge them which is a feature that is nice.

It cuts out the music whilst answering the calls. Also buttons to go forwards and backwards through the songs and also buttons to allow you to adjust the sound. I was able to take the speaker around the whole house with me during the day. The battery lasted 10 hours. I was amazed. It now automatically connects when I switch it on due to the NFC function but I admit when pairing for the first time you need to have the item close to speaker to enable it to pair so easily.

It does this just fine, in good style comparable to the original.  Pros: * Look is very similar to the original (one more snap, same color) * Fit is a tiny bit tight, but it does go on OK * Length is perfect * The cushioning is nice; I don't feel the headphones' weight up there at all  Cons: * The material feels delicate, like it'll probably wear out faster than the original; time will tell * The underside material (what contacts the metal band) is not nearly as durable as the material in the original, which is quite tough. This may never become an issue, but given how the DT 770's adjustment never stays put, this could manifest in some internal tears.  Other thoughts: * For the price, a nice replacement headband. I'll update periodically as it ages to note how it has performed. So far so good.  Followup: Nine months in, and I'm upping to 5-star because it's lasting, taking normal use and minor abuse like falling prey to cat shenanigans. No rips and tears, still soft.  Followup -- Oct 2015: still going strong, no tears, no snags. I am impressed and have amended my earlier concerns about not being heavy-duty.

10714,10715,__label2__,4,N,Electronics,B007B5WHTE,Philips CSS2123B/F7 Soundbar with Subwoofer (Black),Decent for the price.,"I bought this along with a similar model, the HTL7180, for the same $99 price. I wanted to compare. The CSS sounds much better. The sound is smoother. The bass is fuller. The dialogue is clearer. The remote seems better. And overall, the CSS is a big improvement over the older HTL, which is still for sale, but apparently discontinued. I returned that one to Walmart.<br />I have the CSS hooked up to a new model 32 inch Vizio smart TV with built-in apps. It's a master bedroom application. I think I will keep this unit since it performs well enough. It sounds better on music actually, than as a movie soundbar. Its simulated surround sounds sounds better than the HTL also. That one sounded like too much reverb. I wouldn't turn this unit up much past 30% unless your ears are oblivious to distortion.<br />The remote has adjustments for bass and treble, but they are minimal. This improves on the sounds of the TV speakers, obviously. A bonus is that its not too tall so it doesn't interfere with the TV infrared remote.<br />I have a feeling  the whole TV soundbar craze is going to disappear soon as TV makers figure out ways to make tvs sound better without all this extra junk cluttering up rooms. Soundbars will probably go the way of VHS players and Sony Walkmen in due time. But until then, this $99 unit serves the purpose adequately."

The ear cushions are supple and comfortable, even for wearing for extended periods. I acknowledge that I'm not a hardcore audiophile, but I've been listening to music since 78-rpm phonograph records were the primary media, so I do have some idea what good audio sounds like. I ran through one of my favorite playlists, and the music sounded as good or better than with any of the headphones that I've used. Vocals had excellent clarity, and the range of sound was very good with rich trebles and deep, but not overpowering, bass. One feature that I haven't seen on any headphones that I've used is the bass level control, a rotating dial on the left headphone. To my ears, it had a small but noticeable effect on the bass level, but my preference was to leave it in the default position.<br /><br />Two of the songs that I use to check out headphones and speakers are Annie Lennox's ""Love Song For A Vampire"" (listen for the heartbeat in the background) and The Surfaris' ""Wipe Out"" with drummer Ron Wilson's continuous drum riff. Both sounded great with the MX7 headphones. I also played a couple of stereo setup utilities (""Channel Balance Test"" and ""Stepped Stereo Pan Test""), and the headphones passed with flying colors.<br /><br />The headphones are very comfortable to wear for extended periods. I wore them for a hour on two occasions while evaluating them. The adjustable headbands allowed a good fit, and the thick ear cushions were comfortable. Both headbands will extend up to 1½"", and the earcups will rotate about 15 degrees horizontally for the most comfortable fit.<br /><br />The headphone kit includes a 52"" cable with an inline microphone (for using with a smartphone) and 3.5mm plugs. The plug that fits into the headphones has a rotating locking mechanism that ensures that the plug can't work loose, a very helpful feature. The headphones and cable fit nicely ina zippered soft case.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Pioneer SE-MX7-K headphones are premium-quality headphones that combine exceptional audio quality and comfortable design to give a very pleasurable listening experience."
10837,10838,__label2__,4,N,Electronics,B00BXJZ30Y,iLuv Syren iPhone 6 NFC Compatible Bluetooth Portable Speaker (Black),Not bad but rather overpriced,"The good is that this pairs easily with most bt devices, and as a speakerphone it's quite adequate. It looks pretty nice, though this leads to...<br /><br />The not so good is that though this looks iSleek, that emphasis on looks over functionality made them stick the pause button for receiving calls on the back of the speaker. Since it's slanted, this is just silly in every way. Other negatives are that while this sounds ok for voice, for music it's merely fair, and that it's not the heavy duty construction you'd expect at this price.<br /><br />It's a decent little speaker-phone/speaker combo, but 50 is too much for this somewhat flimsy piece of plastic, however shiny. 25 to 30 is what this is really worth, I'd say. And that button on the back must give one pause, as it were, as to whether that feature will make the speakerphone aspect worth pursuing.<br /><br />Amazing how designers just don't really think things through, or place form over function so often.<br />In a world of cheap disposable crap, that crap should at least make perfect sense while it does indeed work.<br /><br />Bluetooth is still a selling point so companies are getting away with overpricing simple bt items.

Eventually I plan on purchasing a second PLAY:5 to use them as a stereo pair in my bedroom, or to move into separate rooms while cleaning the house.<br /><br />In regards to the SONOS system as a whole; I had initial misgivings before making the purchase, mainly due to price and the effective locking-in to the SONOS ecosystem. I have a variety of Apple products and I'd previously been quite happy using my AppleTV with AirPlay to stream music to my main audio system, but was looking for a portable speaker to use in the bedroom and outside on the patio.<br /><br />I had been very tempted by some of the B&W AirPlay speakers, but I started looking at SONOS tech for the following reasons:<br /><br />- AirPlay from a mobile device can only stream to a single speaker. A laptop or desktop can stream to multiple destinations, but isn't as convenient as an iPhone or iPad for music control.<br />- AirPlay is very dependent on the quality of your home WiFi network. Any interruptions or glitches in the wireless connection will cause issues with the stream.<br /><br />The SONOS system sets up it's own independent WiFi network as to not be impacted by the usage of your home network. SONOS devices stream the music directly from the internet or your music library requiring only your mobile devices (Android / iOS phones and tablets) to be used for remote control.<br /><br />Setup is very easy, authorization of additional devices or controllers is done by a simple button press on an existing device.<br /><br />The core thing to be aware of is that for the SONOS devices to connect to the internet, one of them MUST have an Ethernet connection to your home network. All SONOS devices come with an Ethernet network port, and SONOS sells $50 the BRIDGE device specifically to perform this role if you don't already have another device in range of an Ethernet port.<br /><br />In my case I purchased a PLAY:5 and a CONNECT device. The PLAY:5 is in my bedroom and the CONNECT is hooked up to my home theater receiver via a digital optical connection. The CONNECT plays the part of the BRIDGE as it is connected directly to my home network so I didn't need to purchase a BRIDGE.<br /><br />I can heartily recommend the SONOS system and do so regularly to colleagues, friends, and just about anyone who'll listen."

Recently, I had the opportunity to use and try the MEELECTRONICS SPORT-FI M6P NOISE ISOLATING IN-EAR HEADPHONES WITH MICROPHONE, REMOTE, AND UNIVERSAL VOLUME CONTROL.  For the retail price these headphones sell for, they are an incredible good buy. I've had some headphones that cost around $150 and the MEE ELECTRONICS SPORT-FI M6-P HEADPHONES are just as good in sound quality as those.<br /><br />These headphones are more like earbuds since they actually go inside one's ear instead of over them. However, unlike some other earbuds I've used, these hurt my ears after extended use.  Each part of the headphone is designed for a particular ear: one piece has a small ""R"" for the right side of one's head while the other is marked with a ""L"" for the left side of one's head.  The design of the earbuds also makes them good for exercise. However, as I've only used them while briskly walking, I can't say for sure how they will do while running or doing more strenuous exercise. However, the headphones do come equipped with a small clip (like a microphone clip) that can clip on to a piece of clothing.<br /><br /> In terms of aesthetics, I don't like the look of these headphones. It's not a terrible design, but even in the black color I just don't find them as visually pleasing as other headphones I've used and seen.<br /><br />While listening to music are a video with the headphones on, the sound doesn't escape the headphones unless the volume is turned up extremely high. Also, although they aren't designed as ear plugs, the headphones also work rather well at keeping most outside noises out.<br /><br />These headphones are also equipped with a microphone and volume control. I have not used these headphones as a microphone so I can't say how they function in that capacity.<br /><br />Overall, the MEELECTRONICS SPORT-FI M6P NOISE ISOLATING IN-EARHEADPHONES WITH MICROPHONE, REMOTE, AND UNIVERSAL VOLUME CONTROL are a good set of headphones for the price."

Monster has taken the headphone market by storm and grabbed a huge market share. Why? Is it because they are really good or is it because they are experts on marketing their products? Don't know but it's probably both.<br /><br /> These bright cobalt blue ear-buds have a very good sound. The treble is sweet and high without being tinny. The base is surprisingly good for ear-buds and it doesn't sound muddy. The mids fill in the middle well. The overall sound is crisp without being harsh, smooth without being muddy.<br /><br />The cable is 50 inches long.<br /><br />The packaging looks great if you are giving them as a gift.<br /><br />Lightweight so not to pull out of the ear easily.<br /><br />Three sizes of lite rubber ear cups are provided so they should fit just about anyone.<br /><br />Comes with a small velcro tie for keeping the cable wrapped up and a lapel clip.<br /><br />The ear-buds are magnetized on the back so you can stick the two ends together.<br /><br />For the price it would have been nice to have a case included.<br /><br />Well constructed with a solid feel.<br /><br />The jack turns at a 45 degree angle.<br /><br />Can be used for cell phone use with built-in mic. (I do not use this controller)<br /><br />The cable is flat instead of the usual round which seems to not tangle as easily.<br /><br />Overall these are a great sounding pair of ear-buds. Although pricier then many products out there they are way cheaper then high-esr in-the-ear phones. I think you'll be pleased with them.<br /><br />NOTE: IF YOU WANT THE BEST SOUND OUT OF ANY EAR-BUDS, IF YOU ARE USING A SMART PHONE OR TABLET, DOWNLOAD A GOOD EQUALIZER APP. THERE ARE MANY ON THE MARKET AND MOST OF THEM WILL BRING YOUR MUSIC TO A NEW LEVEL."

I have a BACKUPS-XS1500 LCD uninteruptable power supply and recently needed to replace the batteries.  I didn't realize until I pulled out the APC batteries and realized there was a brand name below the white APC label that APC had slapped over the sides of the batteries, in essence putting their name on someone else's battery products.  Mine was a company named Vision.  Based on research, I discovered that APC utilizes a variety of battery manufacturers and slapped their labels on them and charges a premium.  With that being said, it is not necessary to buy an APC labeled battery for your UPS.  Find a name brand that you are comfortable with that fits the specifications of your battery.  You can, like I did, pull the label off and see who the true manufacturer is and the specifications.  In my case, I have a dual battery, meaning I have to buy two individual 12 Volt batteries and put them together into my UPS.<br /><br />So it is not necessary to pay a premium for a APC labeled battery, just go with a reasonably priced option that has a name brand and good reviews and you will be fine."

Get a good pair of speakers and you're 'all set'!","I sure do miss the glory days of hi-fi, when high quality stereo receivers, preamplifiers, amplifiers, and true speaker systems ruled the day!  Now everything is miniaturized and portable, with sound quality often suffering bigtime.  Sure MP3 files, iPODs, iPADs, and PC's (with their small speakers) are convenient ways to get (download) and carry music around with you, but you're missing out on palpable bass, a natural soundstage, and musical detail when you listen to most pairs of compromised headphones or PC speakers, sadly typical of most music listening done today.  Do yourselves a big favor-  if you truly love music and you wish to listen to music in all it's grandness and glory, get a good integrated amplifier (or separates- preamp and amp combo), and a great set of speakers to hook up your digital files player or PC to.  Your ears will thank you!  Contrary to belief, you really don't have to spend a fortune if you know what to look for.  Knowledge is power, and equates to savings too.  The great thing about this integrated amp is that it already has an excellent built-in Wolfson DAC, and Onkyo is a respected name in audio going back decades.  I just helped my neighbor (college student) select his very first stereo system with conventional speakers, and I suggested this integrated amp.  He also wanted a pair of good bookshelf speakers, and he ended up with JBL ES30's.  His budget was $700, which was met (including RCA to mini-plug stereo cable and a short run of thick speaker wire).  We were both floored when we listened to some of his higher-res digital files through the Onkyo and JBL's!  He said, and I quote:  &#34;I can now hear nuances i've never heard before, and I can now feel my music!  I never knew my iPOD could sound so great!&#34;  'Nuff said!"

Mounting worked well, but these brackets have a fair amount of flexibility which makes them &#34;feel like the speaker isn't secure.  It is.  The TV I mounted it to is on a swivel wall mount, and whenever the TV is adjusted the speaker sways back and forth a bit as the metal flexes.  This is made from a fairly thin grade of metal, so it is certainly not rigid.  In our setup, mounted to the TV with the wall mount at the same time, the brackets allow the sound bar to move L-R as well, which means it gets knocked off of &#34;level&#34; fairly easy.<br /><br />All that being said, I like the brackets, but not enough for five stars.

The Sony TV and Time-Warner cable box codes were accepted on first try.  Then it was time to add the Sony DVD player, and the instruction sheet offered 8 codes. I went through the first seven with exponentially diminishing hopes--until I was down to a barely flickering futile flame.  Wouldn't you know--#8 was the right code!  Proof there's a god after all!  (All the same, if none of the numbers works, there's another form of entry to try called ""Code Search."")<br /><br />Lesson learned. Never give up--never.  But if you're struggling with this inexpensive gadget for more than 20 minutes, don't hesitate to toss it.  Life is too short--and the distance between me and my TV isn't really that long.  Moreover, there's no way to store favorite channels--even a mere several. That wouldn't be a problem were it not for Time-Warner's 2000-channel line-up (and of course the HD channels are all up in the 4-digit zone).<br /><br />Anyway, this $5 toy is a potentially useful ""spare.""

This protector easily fit the bill. I looked at several squid-style protectors, but they usually didn't have enough outlets. Not only does this have eight rotating outlets, it has four more stationary outlets in the center for an incredible twelve outlets.<br /><br />The unit was also simple to mount to the wall. I just used a few screws that I had sitting around and some drywall anchors and had the plug mounted on the wall in minutes. I am not any sort of do-it-yourself expert.<br /><br />Finally, one of the really great—but perhaps less-noticed—features of this strip is its cord organizer. The clip on the bottom is an easy way to tuck away all of your cords and send them off in the same direction. Not only does that make it easier to, for example, use some other cord system on the bundle of plugs (like a tube or zip ties), it helps keep the cords neat even if you don't use any other cord-management tools.<br /><br />This is particularly useful if, for example, you're using this strip for an aquarium or other water-related project, because the clip helps you make a drip loop without having to add more holes to the wall, etc.<br /><br />In sum, this is a great power strip. I strongly recommend it to others."

11309,11310,__label2__,5,N,Electronics,B00945RAQY,Sony HTCT260 Sound Bar Home Theater System (Discontinued by Manufacturer),"I upgraded my HTCT100 and couldn't be happier - expansive sound, easy setup, and great price - Bluetooth a major bonus as well","Premium television sets used to advertise their screen size, image sharpness, and sound quality.  Not any more.  When you buy the latest LG, Sony, or any other LCD, LED, or Plasma display, the speakers are always on the back and very tinny with little bass response.  In short, the television manufacturers do not expect you to actually use the speakers in the TV.  Many diehard audiophiles will decide to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on stereo receivers hooked up to surround sound speakers.  For those with lots of money, space, and the time to set it up, these home theaters can be great.  For the rest of us, we want quality sound from our televisions that is compact and easy to setup.  This is the place where the Sound Bar really shines.<br /><br />There are many brands with some similarities - you typically get a long speaker to go under the TV itself, either on its own stand or mounted on the wall.  There is also a separate sub-woofer for deep noise response.<br /><br />This Sony HTCT260 was an upgrade to my existing Sony HTCT100.  Despite similar names, they are quite different.  To start, the Sony HTCT100 was a total of 250W of sound - three 50W speakers in the bar and a 100W subwoofer.  The Sony HTCT260 is 300W - two 85W front speakers and a 130W subwoofer.  Whether the front is two or three speakers is immaterial - they are all inside a single bar.<br /><br />The Sony HTCT100 had a subwoofer that plugged into the wall, and the audio from the source plugged into the subwoofer.  Then the Sound Bar plugged into the subwoofer with a proprietary cable.  That meant the subwoofer had to be near the sound bar.  However, it also meant that the subwoofer was a receiver in itself, with HDMI pass thru, analog input, and optical input.  HDMI pass-thru means you can plug your Blu-Ray player into the subwoofer, and then plug the subwoofer into the TV.  It had multiple HDMI inputs so the Sony HTCT100 could switch between sources.<br /><br />The Sony HTCT260 does away with the HDMI select capability - in fact, it doesn't have HDMI input at all, and the inputs are on the sound bar, not the sub-woofer.  The sub-woofer is a remote wireless device, so it can be placed anywhere, a major bonus.  It is shorter than the HTCT100 subwoofer, despite being more watts, is easier to conceal.  The only inputs are on the bar itself, consisting of Analog, Coaxial, and Optical.  Why did they make this change?  Consider my use of the HTCT100.  When I bought a TV that had networking capability, it meant that half the time I was using my TV, it was for content from the TV itself.  Since my TV had lots of HDMI inputs, it meant every device could also plug into the TV.  I eventually stopped using the HDMI passthrough and just plugged the optical out from my TV into the HTCT100.<br /><br />Since I assume most people have similar televisions now, the removal of the HDMI inputs and the wireless subwoofer of the HTCT260 makes sense.<br /><br />In terms of style, the sound bar is sharp looking, a little longer and wider than the HTCT100, and with a built-in display, it looks really good in my TV setup.  There are touch sensitive input select and volume buttons on the front, so you can adjust it even if you lose the remote control.<br /><br />Most important, how does it sound?  In a word, amazing.  I was dubious that the extra 50W would mean anything, but I found the sound far more immersive and expansive than with the HTCT100.  Previously on the HTCT100, I had actually hit the MAX and still thought the sound was too quiet for some sources, but now I can crank up the volume and actually get it too loud.  The bass is full and can be felt, but is not overpowering.  Simple ""sound field"" buttons on the remote allow you to adjust the effect for movies, games, or music.  With the subwoofer placed in the back of the room, I can achieve most of the surround sound effect without having to run wires and place tons of speakers.<br /><br />Finally, pairing the speaker with my iPhone via Bluetooth couldn't be simpler.  I hit ""Pairing"" on the remote, and about 30 seconds later I was blasting Tchaikovsky through the speakers from the iPhone.<br /><br />Highly recommended - I'm sure you could get better sound with a more expensive system, but bang for the buck, I am totally happy with this sound bar and highly recommend you get one to go with your new television set."

I use this primarily for the time, date, temperature display and for that it works great. The instructions are very easy to follow. I have tested out all the features and some work great while others are a mixed bag. -Time/date. Very straight forward and the orange glow through the wood is great. The snooze button dims the display which is normally the setting I have it on. Note: the dot in the upper left corner of the time display means pm. -Temperature. I find this to be pretty accurate but it does depend where the back of the block is facing, for example if it's facing a window it will likely not be an accurate reading of the room temperature. The directions say it can be up to two degrees off. -Alarms. These work consistently fine and are fairly easy to set. -Speaker. The bluetooth is automatically on when plugged in and will show up when searching for devices on your portable device. To shut the bluetooth off you hold the call/pause button down for 3 seconds. Sound quality wasn't the best I've ever heard but it was decently loud and much better than expected. If you are looking primarily for a bluetooth speaker I would look elsewhere though. There is also an aux in for devices that don't have bluetooth. -Wireless charger. Even without a case on this won't charge my phone and appears to be faulty. Do not buy for the wireless charging aspect. For me this isn't a deal breaker as there is a usb plug in for charging and I have found most of these wireless chargers to be slow and unreliable. -Usb plug in. You can plug in your charging cable to this and it charges fine and eliminates the need to plug in a wall charger. This makes up for the wireless charger in my opinion.  Build quality seems good and sturdy and the product has a good weight. One thing to note is that the product is a bit larger and wider than I expected and does take up my whole night table. The product measure about 9&#34;x 5.5&#34;x 2.5&#34;. Overall super unique and I recommend it even if all the features aren't up to par. HOWEVER I want to make it clear that if you are purchasing this it would be for looks (which I personally think looks awesome) not so much for features.

The Remix5 is water resistant, not water proof, so it will work if it gets rained on but not so much if it's dropped in the lake or ocean!<br />The Remix5 has output of 5W which is perfect for me, I'm happy with the clear sound, distinct bass and all around great sound.<br />The bottom  of the Remix5 has a small black on and off switch, a micro-USB input for charging, a tiny microphone hole and a small bright blue LED light that lights up when the power is on.<br />Turn on the Remix5 there are five ascending beeps that verify it's ready to pair and pairing is super fast and easy!! Seriously it pairs faster and easier than some of my other speakers! About 10 seconds and the Remix5 speaker was paired with my iPad.<br /><br />BONUS!! There is a hinge flap that folds over this compartment space to cover and protect it from the elements. PERFECT for camping and trips to the beach.  The speaker itself is covered with a bright red screen for great protection.<br />On the outer corner of the Remix5 flush with the black rubber coating are three buttons; play, plus and minus; press the forward button for the next song and minus for the previous song.<br />What's in the box; The Remix5 speaker, a charging cord with the Micro-USB port on one end that splits into two cords; one the USB port for charging and the other a 3.5mm cord for accessing music from another source than Bluetooth. Brighttech also includes a thick rubber wrist strap that can be attached to the device.<br /><br />I received a Remix5 for the purpose of this review. Opinions are 100% my own."

They have a tendency to rip near the jack, but for the price and sound quality I just replace them each time that happens (every 8 months or so). When I got an iPhone I tried on the apple earbuds and discarded them immediately. So painful. I came straight to amazon and bought these.<br /><br />They fit in my ears as well as ever. They come with different sizes so it's easy to find one for you. My only complaint so far is that the microphone feels too high up on the wire, and that it's a bit flimsy feeling. The flip side of that is that I appreciate that it's very light weight and doesn't feel like I have a weight dangling from my left ear. I'm sure I'll get used to its high position.<br /><br />On a side note the in-ear portion is interchangeable with all other Sony earbuds and most of the style in general. I put some blue ones on and I really like the red, white and blue effect. 'Murica."

I had high hopes for this unit, but it only improved the signal enough for the TV to recognize 36 (3-6 more) channels in the bedroom.  Unfortunately I'm still not getting the stations I really want.  Even still, I might keep and use the unit because I think it would boost the signal enough to help with some of the flakier stations in the living room, but it runs really hot and doesn't work at all when it's not plugged in (so I can't unplug it when I leave the house without disabling my webcam).

13389,13390,__label2__,1,Y,Electronics,B000NUYW92,"JVC HARX300 Full-Size Headphones, Black",Opinion from a user of many headphones including other JVC headphones,"First off let me tell you I am a stickler for sound and I know sound. In my business I have to know it very well too. I've been a musician and recording engineer for nearly 25 years. I've mixed and mastered many different compositions in many styles. I've used some of the best equipment and studio monitors out there and have also used headphones of many varieties and qualities. When it comes to mixing tracks it can be extremely tricky. That is why a good recording engineer once a composition is mixed will have you listen to it on the studio monitors, then with headphones. He'll take you to his car and listen to it on his car stereo, on his MP3 player, on his home theater receiver. You then make adjustments to get the basic over-all balance calculating what works with one set of speakers and what does not on another.  So why may you ask would someone who presumable knows sound like I say I do be reviewing a cheap $16 set of headphones. Well I'll explain now. My choice for both recording and preliminary mixing in the studio has come down to headphones. I used many different kinds of headphones in my career and some of the best out there either pushed too much on the low end, mid or hi. I could never find a set that had a good balance of all of them. By chance my cat ate the cables on a set of Sennheiser headphones I once used for just listening to music and gaming and so fourth. So I got my self a pair of JVC &#34;FLATS&#34;, and I was nailed with major WOW factor. I mean here they were. JVC made a cheap headphone that has a nice crisp clean highs, lovely mid range territory and just enough bass to not feel overly cheated. I eventually decided they were just right for mixing preliminary in the studio too. They work better than many extremely expensive sets I've used. They have a decent magnet, the ear cups cuddle the ears solidly and the sound is nice and close to the ear. The result is pretty accurate mids, very good highs, and acceptable lows. I liked them so much I've own several pairs. I just purchased another pair to add in with other sets of headphones I own of all kinds and values. I still keep going back to these Flats for everything. I also purchased a pair of these JVC HARX300's.  The problem with these JVC HARX300's is that though they are built pretty solidly and look nice, sadly they put out a muddy midrange that does not sound natural, they also bury upper mids and highs miserably. Only the crispest of upper highs can be heard and it is subtle and buried. Bass is full and pretty deep, but even that has an unsatisfying and unnatural sound to it. In fact as best as I can asertain, these may be in my top 10 worst headphones I've ever heard. Which is a total shame because I love JVC's Flats as well as their earbuds and Walkman styles they make,. Most sound better than you'd expect. As it so happens they struck gold with their series of FLATS. They really are both inexpensive and have amazing sound. But sadly these HARX300's just sound plain terrible.  I do know sound well enough to know that if your ears grow accustom to the same headphones they can actually become weaker in connecting with certain frequencies put out by other headphones. I took this into consideration and listened to these for quite awhile as well as other headphones to be sure what I was hearing was what many other people would hear. If you are going to purchase a pair of these, purchase a pair of JVC's FLATS in any of their different colors. Try these first then try the flats. Something tells me you keep the flats and ship these back, which is exactly what I am going to do.  These headphones sadly, really the only way I can say this is to be blunt..... they suck and it's that simple. No offense, but anyone who tells you these have great sound does not know what great sound is on a set of headphones. and they have no idea what they are missing. But it just so happens that I do. I strongly urge you that if you want a bargain set of headphones that have great sound  get the FLATS and pass these up. The flats totally kick ass, these just plain suck."

The input plug is very robust and I love the fabric chord. I haven't had any problems with the soft in-ear pieces falling off, a huge problem I've had with other earbuds. Many times on other earbuds the hard plastic shell that house the speaker components has simply fallen apart on me. I don't see that happening with the Philips Tread because the entire enclosure is coated with a single layer of thick rubber.<br /><br />Sound:<br /><br />  The bass is deep and the treble isn't tinny. Sometimes the sound can be slightly washed out, but it might just be some of the old music I listen to.  I ride the subway into school everyday and they drown out those sounds very well. It isn't quite the same effect as noise cancelling earbuds, but I am impressed.<br /><br />Comfort:<br /><br />  Packaged with the main earbuds are two other covers to a fit a variety of ear styles. I prefer the medium size. They stay in my ears when I want them to and are easily removed with a quick tug on the cord. Worth noting is the fact that the cords are very easy to untangle because of the fabric layer.<br /><br />Overall they are well worth the price just for the build quality alone. There are many earbuds with similar sound quality that I have had in my possession. However, none of these would last over  2-3 months simply because I am a clumsy person. I don't even think they would break if I hit them repeatedly with a hammer."

It has its quirks and it doesn't always do what it's supposed to do, but I happily take this over having multiple remotes. The Help feature on this remote is amazing and while others might consider it a nuisance to have to rely on it, I think it's a blessing. Setting up the remote was complicated at first, but I was able to figure it out after a few tries without reading up on it, though there are still a few functions I'm still not clear on. Logitech customer service is also great. The only device I've tried that this device isn't compatible with is the Amazon Fire TV. You'll need a hub-based remote for that functionality. The learn function also works well. The remote itself is fairly lightweight and feels comfortable. Keep in mind that you have to sync the remote after any change you make to the settings, and syncing isn't wireless. The included usb cable is required. It only gets tiresome if you're constantly changing the settings or configuration of your home entertainment setup.  Edit 9/20/15: Unfortunately, I have to change my good review. After a few months, this remote has become increasingly frustrating. It was at the point where I couldn't do anything at all without the help button. It wouldn't switch to the correct devices. It even stopped turning on my TV. I finally spoke with a tech support person who spent a lot of time fixing the issue. It's now better, but still has its glitches. I wouldn't recommend."

It's priced to compete with similarly priced NAD, Rotel, and Parasound offerings, but frankly, it's in a different galaxy from those products.<br /><br />Before expressing more praise for this amplifier, however, I have to provide an account of my experience with it. I was an early purchaser of the JOB 225, and like a number of other early purchasers of this amplifier, I had a problem with 60 Hz hum emanating from the loudspeakers. When I contacted JOB Electronics (apparently a marque of the ultra-high-end brand Goldmund), the company at first seemed skeptical that there was a problem with the amplifier.<br /><br />Once JOB/Goldmund acknowledged the problem, however, the response was swift. JOB paid for return shipping to Switzerland and had my amplifier back in my possession within two business days. The problem with 60 Hz hum was gone. Reportedly, other users with humming JOB 225s will be able to ship their amplifiers to a service center in NYC for repair/modification.<br /><br />The repaired/modified JOB 225 sounds spectacularly transparent. Adding this amp to my system has expanded soundstage width and depth, and increased image specificity.<br /><br />Before purchasing this amp, keep in mind both that output power is limited and that the amp generates a lot of heat. Use with electrostatic or other difficult-to-drive speakers should be ruled out. Use with truly high-end speakers nevertheless appears possible. One user has reported extraordinary results with TAD CR-1s.<br /><br />In all, I'm pleased with my purchase. I would have rated it five stars if not for the initial 60 Hz hum problem.<br /><br />NOTE ON SHIPPING: Though Amazon reports an estimated delivery time several weeks away, I and all other JOB 225 users with whom I've communicated received our amps in a couple of business days via FedEx International Priority. Yes, you get shipping at Amazon Prime speed from Geneva for $70."

I was impressed, and this reception was from the inside of my attic!  Unfortunately, this antenna could not receive my favorite two channels 2-1 and 2-2, which I sadly learned are NOT in the UHF band, but are in the VFH-High band.  This antenna (as it clearly states) is a UHF antenna. If you want to receive any VHF-High channels you will need an antenna that is designed for those frequencies.  Perform an internet search for &#34;TV signals near me&#34;, and look at the FCC site and the TVFool site. Both sites are extremely helpful, and give recommendations as to the type of antenna you need and the compass-pointing information to help you aim your antenna to receive the strongest signal.  If you don't need to pick up channels 2 through 5, then this antenna will be the best antenna you ever bought!<br />I ended up replacing this antenna with a $45 model RCA ANT751 (bought from this site), and couldn't be happier.

I'm no audiophile, but the bass sounds solid to me and the mids and highs are crisp enough for me. I have not had to charge them since the initial charge, and that was two weeks ago. I listen for 1-3 hours a day. The controls are not as intuitive as I'd like, simply because they are exactly the same on each side, so if I forget which side the volume is on I can accidentally skip forward or back a track by using the those controls on the other side. They are very comfortable, and I wear glasses, even, but after about 3 hours I'm ready to take them off.

Before I started using the SOL AMPS, I was a pretty committed SkullCandy user.  Specifically I had the SkullCandy Ink'd 2 and Smokin' Buds 2.  I honestly didn't have any problem with these except for the occasional times when they will fall apart.  I got the SOL AMPS for fun and I'm really glad I picked them out and this is why...<br /><br />DESIGN<br />I wanted something different from SkullCandy and I thought the style of these looked fun and unique.  The SOL logo on the side definitely looks attractive.  I also like how the buds are angled so you can get a better fit.  I was a little worried about the outer part being abnormally large and odd when they are in my ears, but it doesn't really bother me, and in fact it feels very comfortable...<br /><br />COMFORT<br />These are one of the best fitting ear headphones I've ever tried.  They are so comfortable that I sometimes forget I have them in my ears when the music isn't playing.  While the SkullCandy buds fits me fairly well, they don't fit other people when they ask to borrow my SkullCandy headphones.  However, the fitting of the SOL AMPS is perfect.  It feels very snug.  I have exercised (ex. running on treadmill, weightlifting, biking, etc.) using both SkullCandy and SOL AMPS and the SOL AMPS are superior by far.  I never feel like they are going to fall out no matter how much I sweat or move.  These headphones are definitely a plus in comfort.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY<br />The switch from SkullCandy to SOL AMPS is phenomenal.  I feel like I can hear a crisp sound compared to SkullCandy.  I love SkullCandy and thought it was great but wow these definitely give an additional boost to the bass.  The bass isn't overwhelming and it sounds just right.  I'm a person who listens a WIDE range of music (ex. Electronic, Rap, Country, to Classical) and the quality doesn't sound lost in all of the genres.<br /><br />MIC and VOLUME<br />I've used this for calls and skype and I never have problems talking or hearing people.  I sometimes have to hold the mic portion close to my mouth to make myself clearer but this isn't really a problem for me.  This is definitely a nice feature.<br /><br />Having the controls for the volume is so wonderful.  It definitely eliminates the hassle of taking taking out your phone (I have an iPhone) to adjust the volume or even shuffling music.  I use these buttons (almost as an abuse) because that's how convenient they are.  When I am using the SOL AMPS on the bus or any public areas, I never hear any background noises and in addition I can have the volume high without bothering the person who is next to me.<br /><br />PRICE<br />I bought these for a little more than what it is selling on Amazon.  I think these headphones are definitely worth the price!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a treat to an enjoyable experience.  Good job Sol Republic!"

A dual lnb is for connecting 2 receivers to 1 dish, not for connecting one receiver to 2 satellites. It will receive either 118.7 or 119 satellites but not both simultaniously. This was why I asked if you had 2 lnb's.

Many reviewers will note that it is too narrow to span two studs.  My installation was a brick wall on the exterior of my house so this was not an issue.  The included anchors worked great for this.  Drill a 3/8 hole for the anchors, NOT the slightly larger M10 that is recommended in the instructions.  I drilled 3/8 with intentions to enlarge the hole from there but found the anchors fit almost loose in the smaller hole and any larger would have been a problem. Also, for any led small enough for this bracket will work fine in drywall with the anchors.  My 32in is only 10.1 pounds, and many 40&#34; led TVs are around 19 pounds  You need a hammer drill to drill into concrete or brick!  You will burn up masonry bits and spend hours fighting it with a regular drill.  With a hammer drill installing this will be a 15 minute job.  I don't know if the product has changed or not, but after reading reviews of this being thin and cheap I can say there is no way mine is the same as theirs, you can't mistake this for cheap.  It's easily up to its rating.  It comes with tons of screw sizes to mount to your TV, except M4 like I needed.  .80cents at home depot and this this was ready to roll."

When connected at full volume the audio is very loud which is great for those who need it. Sound quality is average, good but not amazing. But that's what you can expect with a price this low.<br /><br />I would recommend that you open up the speakers (to expose the spring like white plastic) very sparingly. Since that is made of thin plastic it tends to rip pretty easily, pretty soon all of it would be ripped and the only thing connecting the bottom and top half would be a couple of wires. This happened to me within a month or so, but I did use it everyday. Opening up only gives you slightly more bass and I personally feel that its not so great sounding that it would warrant you risking breaking it.<br /><br />Aside from that it still works great and I have had for about a year.

Yes, it does get a little hot with continuous use as other reviewers stated before.<br />I bought mine in October 2013, and it does remove HDCP protection (tested with a PS3) which is the main reason you might be taking a look at this item.<br />It is quite small and &#34;portable&#34; (sans the power supply) so you would have no problem hiding it.<br /><br />The main issue with my unit (perhaps defective?) is that the sound will either crack or just be gone completely. I'm yet to find out if the problem is due to the TV, the capture card ([[ASIN:B00840353W Elgato Game Capture HD (10025010)]]) or this unit, but in any case I don't lose too much sleep over it as I'm using optical audio to playback and record (as opposed to audio via HDMI) but it's definitely something you should have in mind, if not using the optical out port of whatever device you intend to capture.<br /><br />Overall it works for my purpose (HDCP breaking) and I'm happy with the product, but I already found a similar product (not on amazon so cannot link) that apparently works and doesn't require a power supply, so I might be heading towards that direction (the power supply is something I quite not like that much about this product, as it's one extra thing to be taking space on my -already getting crowded- UPS).<br /><br />I haven't had the chance to try 3D yet to see if it works, maybe when I do I'll come back and update the review."

After using one these for a couple of days that I borrowed from my friend, I realized why these are $49 more expensive than the QC15's.<br />First of all it is more usable in public, due to is small and sleek design. I wouldn't use a pair of QC15's while walking on the street. Comparing the sound of these two, QC15's has better clarity and surround, but the bass is a little weak. QC's may not have the clairty and surround like the QC15's, but it's an on ear headphone and has a better bass response and well balanced sound, which is perfect for myself personally. I find the rechargeable battery in the QC3's more convenient than the AAA sized batteries in the QC15's. For instance, u run out of batteries in the middle of the night, it wouldn't be very convenient to go out and get batteries, whereas u have the convenience to recharge ur QC3 batteries almost anywhere.<br />I rate the sound, design and ease of use better than the QC15's, not to say that the QC15's are bad, but if you don't mind the weaker bass and u dig the absolute crisp and clarity in a headphone and use it mostly for traveling or at home then QC15 is the way to go. And again this is my personal opinion, which may or may not be the same for everyone.<br />Well I can't thank the BOSE customer service enough.

Even though the speakers are different brands, their tonal quality and impedance are very similar. Sounds great, easily pushes the speakers and gets more than loud enough without going above 40% on the volume. The bonus is that it takes up less than 25% of the shelf space of the old receiver.

Not to say they don't sound good. They do. Pros and cons. Pros you can hang the base on the wall within reach of your favorite source, be it your tv or stereo or whatever and in my case, I have a stereo in the basement and TV and receiver upstairs. The reason I mention this is because. I sometimes hook the set downstairs, put on some cd's or vinyl and sit on the porch and they sound fine (about 30 feet distance) When the wife goes to bed, I connect to the T.V upstairs and listen to the game (loud). It comes with 1/4 adaptor and it comes off leaving the 1/8 inch which fits most computers etc. It has an adjustment setting (3 way) on the base for best frequency and a dial on the headset to make it more clear. In some cases it takes a few minutes to get the settings right. Which brings the Con (or one of them) The volume control is directly above where you adjust the frequency settings so if you're not paying attention you can accidently adjust frequency when you want to turn the volume up. The only other con is (and it's only because it isn't in the manual) is this. If you adjust the headset (as in pull one side down to adjust for your head, You have to put both sides all the way back up before putting the headset on the base for charging. Now this should be obvious but I adjusted my headset and was jamming and dropped the headset. When I went to charge them it wouldn't sit straight on the stand and I thought I bent them by dropping them. I even started pulling the headset a little so it would sit even on the base. It wasn't until I started really looking at the headset on the base where I did the (duh) and walked over and pushed both earpieces up and set it back on the base. It was fine. These are really comfortable as well. These are definitely worth the price and I would buy again. When playing audiophile quality don't expect them to perform like your speakers (if they are a good set) But you can also expect good quality sound for the price - They do the job."

This also also HDMI aware as I understand if your devices have this feature you can turn on and off all HDMI devices with one remote.<br /><br />No discernable loss of resolution or audio quality.<br /><br />I recommend this porduct.

19426,19427,__label2__,3,Y,Electronics,B00K3AJGFM,"GOgroove LED Alarm Clock MP3 Stereo 6W Speaker with AUX-In, USB or SD Card Port – Works With Apple iPod , Samsung Galaxy Player , PONO Player , Lonve & More! *Includes Micro-USB Cable*",It works-- just not the way I expected,"There are some things I like about this clock: the sound quality is good and the display is very readable even if you're near-blind without glasses or contacts. It keeps going through frequent power outages during the windy season. It's become a valuable part of my morning routine even though I had to move it out of the bedroom.<br /><br />But that brings us to the cons: 1) The display is bright and can't be dimmed, which my husband loathed when he was trying to sleep. 2) The buttons make a very loud and jarring beep when you push them to set the alarm or change audio functions, and the beep can't be turned off. 3) I had hoped to use the clock as an MP3 player, but you can't shuffle the order of songs or use playlists; if you want to switch to more relaxing or upbeat music, your best bet is to have multiple thumb drives. 4) You'd think you could use the USB port to charge devices, but you can't. 5) The FM radio function is good, but when the radio is turned on, the display doesn't show the time.<br /><br />That said, I don't regret the purchase. I ended up putting this clock in the bathroom, where it functions very well as a night light; it also gets me going with news/music and keeps me on track in the mornings without the distraction of using a smart phone for those purposes. (You know: you go to turn on music and end up reading e-mail, checking apps, and so forth...) The no-frills, non-customizable nature of the interface keeps things simple. In that respect, it exceeded expectations and I'm actually pretty pleased with it!"
19430,19431,__label2__,4,Y,Electronics,B004OA6VZU,iHome IM60PTX Rechargeable Mini Speaker - Pink Translucent,Little disappointed.,I bought this for an unusual use I guess. I wanted to put &#34;them&#34; on my handle bars of my motorcycle. I do not want headphones b/c I feel it distracts from the riding experience and safety. My bike is quiet and I still cannot hear them when I am moving. I also thought that I was getting two and I only got one. I must have missed something in the description. Maybe with two I can hear it better. Otherwise sitting it sounds good and actually has a little bass.
19438,19439,__label2__,4,N,Electronics,B008BDBPT8,Sony STRDN1030 7.2-Channel Network A/V Receiver (Built-in Wi-fi & Bluetooth),STR-DN1030 Review,"I purchased the str-dn1030 Sony A/V receiver to replace an old school Panasonic Receiver I've owned for over a decade. I have a TiVo HD and PS3 Slim input into the str-dn1030 via HDMI. The str-dn1030 outputs to a wall hung 42"" Panasonic Plasma via HDMI. I have internet connected to it via Ethernet. I operate my A/V system with a Harmony 900 (fully RF).<br /><br />The str-dn1030 connected to a 5.1 system and the automatic speaker calibration feature (via the included mic) was very smooth and easy. I really enjoy the sound quality of this unit. The music and sound effects from the opening bank robbery sequence in The Dark Knight (on Bluray) were simply lovely.<br /><br />Video is beautiful.<br /><br />The GUI on the str-dn1030 is almost laughably bad looking and unintuitive, but is perfectly functional with the assistance of the user manual. I am truly perplexed at how bad the GUI is given how Sony can clearly deliver a better product. Perhaps this will be improved in a future firmware update. All this being said, I find the str-dn1030's bad GUI is better than the no GUI on my old Panasonic Receiver.<br /><br />The delay in getting an image from the PS3 or TiVo to my Panny 42"" display upon initially powering on the unit, or when switching inputs, was initially jarring for me. It isn't ridiculously long, but definitely noticeable compared to the near instantaneous sound and signal transmission I had enjoyed with my video outputs going directly to the display (via HDMI) and my audio outputs going directly to my old receiver (via Optical).<br /><br />FYI, an inactivity power off feature appeared to have been enabled by default at the factory with my unit. I thought I was initially going crazy when watching Netflix Instant streaming when the str-dn1030 ""spontaneously"" powered off on my several times in a row. Sure enough the unit was set to power off automatically after a period of inactivity (10 minutes if I recall correctly).<br /><br />I love the str-dn1030's bluetoothaudio streaming function. Especially where the str-dn1030 fires up instantly from standby as soon as you ""connect"" a paired device via bluetooth. I discovered another tricky spot with the user manual. The glossary refers you to page 101 for Bluetooth Pairing...don't fall for it! Go to page 82 instead.<br /><br />I think the build quality of the unit is very good and overall I'm very pleased with the daily functioning of this device."
