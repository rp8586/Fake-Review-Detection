281,282,__label1__,4,N,Books,006114844X,And Only to Deceive (Lady Emily),"Romantic, elegant mystery","The premise of And Only to Deceive excited me enough to get a copy the very same day I first heard about it. The idea of a reverse love story, a woman falling in love with the man she married only after his death, married with the mystery/suspense, as well as the Victorian setting appealed to me very much.<br /><br />Alexander portrayed the romantic part of the romantic suspense in an elegant and intelligent manner. Through reading his journals, Emily is astounded to discover that the ordinary aristocrat she thought she had married harbored passionate love for her and was far more interesting than she knew. This made me question Emily's intelligence and powers of observation, though. Was she so self-absorbed that she didn't take the time to get to know the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with? The more she finds out about Phillip, the more regret grows until Emily falls in love with her dead husband and begins to truly mourn him. Rather than letting her heroine lionize Philip, without question, Alexander then begins to poke holes in his character and Emily's idolatry of him. In keeping with Emily's newfound interest in Greek antiquities and Greek literature, there is a long-running discourse throughout the book regarding who is the better hero, Achilles or Hector. Alexander uses this discourse in subtle comparison to Emily's love for her dead husband - the man she never knew and built up in her mind as an incomparable demi-god (like Achilles) with her flawed (but alive) suitors (like Hector, a human who dares battle Achilles, protected by the gods, to protect his kingdom).<br /><br />I liked Alexander's exploration of Emily's liminal role in Victorian society as a widow, neither mother or wife or virgin bride-to-be. She comes to the realization that without a husband, yet with his fortune, she is basically a free woman, able to do as she pleases within or even out of society.<br /><br />Emily's character, however, made no emotional connection with me. Other than being very beautiful, so much so that her dead husband's secret nickname for her was Kallista (the most beautiful) and being an avid reader, she was not very interesting. I could not see why sophisticated Philip fell in love with her; however, Alexander shows that perhaps, like Emily falling in love with the dead Philip, Philip also fell in love with a figment of his own romantic imagination. He didn't know her, but chose her for her beauty, as Paris chose Helen for hers.<br /><br />Emily develops, however, throughout the course of the story. Initially inspired by her husband's interests, she develops interests of her own: Greek antiquities, learning ancient Greek, the epic poems. She also explores her newfound freedom as an independent woman of means.<br /><br />""Dissatisfied, I put down the book, irritated that Philip was not there. I desperately wanted the chance to argue about these things with him. As I sat there, I slowly began to realize that my own opinions were quite different from those of my husband. Until then I had attributed all my interest in classical antiquity to Phillip and had assumed that his own studies would serve as an adequate guide for mine. I no longer felt driven to study as a way to know Phillip. I wanted to study because I loved the poetry, because the beauty of Greek sculpture moved me...""<br /><br />The suspense part of the novel was lackluster and slow-moving. While I liked the discussion of Greek antiquities and details of the Impressionist art movement, I was never gripped with the fervent need to get to the bottom of whodonit. The sequels sound like they're set in some amazing locales; however, I don't believe I will be continuing this series."

He likely wouldn't see in it any order or unity as a book.<br /><br />In ""How to Stop Believing in Hell"" (on the Kindle list) the narrator describes his life and slow release from spiritual terror without reliance on any religion other than the one he is abandoning. He rejects all the usual doctrines: the existence of the will, morality, the infallibility of any book or person, immortality, the existence of the soul, eternity, Heaven, Purgatory, Armageddon, and Divine judgement. Only then does he find the love of his Creator and cease to fear Hell. It's exciting reading and can be found on Kindle's list."

So when I saw this in a store i thought - great, I could get to read on about Ender and his battles.  However, in order for this book to make some sense, the author had to rework the plot into the plot of Ender's Game, though it was not intented to be in it from the start. For instance, Bean states that during the great battles on Eros, he had to know where every ship was in order to be able to take over if Ender collapsed. However, in Ender's Game, Ender clearly states that the one who had overcontrol over half the fleet was Alai, who was almsot as good as Ender, according to Ender himself. In order to solve this discrepency, the author had Bean state that his performance was reduced because he had to do his part in the battles and also udnerstand the overall strategy, which explains his mediocre performance. In my opinion, this was just the author making excuses.  Not a terrible book, just not a very good one, especially considering how good Ender's Game was. The author would have madea far better job if he had written a book involving Bean five years after the events of Ender's Game, and not relive them from Bean's perspective."

It is better than &#34;Predictably Irrational.&#34; Indeed, people are often irrational, but sometimes what appears to be rational is not. But even in this book, Ariely misses one of the obvious and major reasons people make SEEMINGLY irrational decisions, that are actually quite reasonable and rational from an individual perspective. Our government has increasingly alienated people from individual responsibility and from other citizens, and it has taken the risk out of making decisions.<br /><br />As long as they receive government benefits and hand-outs, most citizens will not look behind the &#34;wizard's curtain.&#34; Nevertheless, modern U.S. Government is unlike any before. Citizens can observe that government is now nothing more than an unsustainable Ponzi scheme. A broad tax base of new taxpayers is needed every year just to pay basic government expenses. Yet, each year, the tax base shrinks (population of taxpayers decreases) and government expenses rise. In the face of this disaster, has government made an all-out effort to cut expenses? Of course not. Government is raising taxes to dangerous and debilitating levels, borrowing huge amounts of money from foreigners, and INCREASING EXPENSES. Obama has quadrupled-down on failure, creating the largest deficit ever. If a private citizen or corporation ran its affairs in this manner, it would be criminally procescuted for fraud.<br /><br />Citizens have internalized the government's ongoing propaganda-of-irresponsibility, and they observe the government's example of irrationality and emotionalism. And now the People are behaving just like their government. This is what government &#34;nudging&#34; has created.<br /><br />For over 60 years now, citizens have been detached from the effects of their negative decisions, whether concerning lifestyle or the effects of bad financial choices. With a constant barrage of government-sponsored propaganda; emotionalism and group-politics have replaced rationality as the bases for decision-making. And modern U.S. government propaganda is the most effective in history, as it employs all the lessons learned and techniques of behavior manipulation from the disciplines of sociology, psychological warfare, and psychology over the past 100 years. There are ongoing propaganda programs promoting and encouraging government provided medical care, unemployment insurance, welfare and social security benefits, free monthly income even for young people, and the chance of filing a lawsuit or getting the government involved when investments go bad. The government conditions citizens to incorrectly believe that correlation is the same as causation; and that appearances and emotional intent are the same as results. The government's goal: promote reliance on government and avoidance of individual responsibility, thought and judgment. Why? To insure ease of public manipulation and the political power of certain groups. Obama oligarch, Cass Sunstein, refers to this conditioning, manipulation and control of citizens as &#34;nudging.&#34;<br /><br />For example, during the recent &#34;subprime mortgage crisis,&#34; which Ariely cites as an example of irrationality, all parties behaved rationally and reasonably, EXCEPT the supposedly rational U.S. Government. Homeowners who could not afford houses knew the government was guaranteeing the loans and, given their minimal down payments, they knew they had little to lose from foreclosure if they could not make payments. Thus, it made perfect sense from their perspective to risk buying homes they could not afford. Similarly, lenders knew the loans were government guaranteed, and the government was threatening lenders with lawsuits and fines if they did not make loans to unqualified buyers, so the lenders knew they had little risk in making imprudent loans. In fact, lenders faced greater risk from government harassment if they did NOT make imprudent loans. Investors in those loans also acted rationally. They understood, correctly, that the government would not allow homeowners, lenders and investors to lose billions or trillions of dollars on a program the government forced on the country. Thus, investors bought loans they knew would probably go into default, because, even if they received no payments from borrowers, the government would rescue financial institutions and investors, which it did. Finally, the only party that did not act rationally was the U.S. government. First, it &#34;incentivized&#34; imprudent economic activity by taking the risk from lenders, borrowers and investors. Then, to make matters much worse, it actually rewarded and has now promoted imprudent financial activity by rescuing all parties to the government created mortgage &#34;crisis.&#34;<br /><br />Over the past 60 years, governments have aggressively promoted irrational risk-taking (which is actually rational for the individual, since he risks nothing), which has spread to all areas of individual human endeavor. Citizens are increasingly losing their good judgment, since the world in which they live is a fiction created by the government, bearing no relation to the real world of finance, economics, and survival based on good decisions. Thus, contrary to Ariely's thesis, the forces of &#34;irrationality&#34; are not hidden. Irrationality is a necessary part of modern government. In fact, many of the programs created by the government have the irrational and exact opposite effect than the one intended. For example, the 1960s &#34;Great Society&#34; and &#34;War on Poverty,&#34; created more poverty. The War on Gun Ownership has resulted in more violence by criminals. The welfare system designed to help families, destroyed families, and created several generations of illegitimate children. Despite billions spent on education; Math, Science and intelligence testing scores are in decline. This is because foolish government bureaucrats and academics have confused correlation with causation. Education does not make people successful. Rather, successful, intelligent people are more likely to finish their education and continue on with their successful lives. It is a waste of money to try to over-educate an unintelligent individual, who should be directed to trade training. Instead, politicians tell us it is preferable students receive diluted, fake degrees. Amazingly, not only does the government not encourage the most intelligent and productive citizens to have children, but instead, the government now subsidizes and promotes the breeding of the least intelligent inhabitants of the country. Incredibly, in many cases, the people receiving these breeding subsidies are not even citizens! There is insufficient space here for a complete list of government irrationalities.<br /><br />It is enough to note that modern government employs techniques similar to the &#34;Cargo Cult&#34; islanders who, by using sympathetic magic, thought that creating the superficial appearances of a system (fake airport and planes), would bring material reward (delivery of cargo). Like modern politicians, the Cargo Cult confused correlation with causation. Citizens have learned the lessons of government irrationality and it has conditioned individual behavior. Many academics and intellectuals, such as Ariely, have lost sight of the fact that human beings are animals that respond in ways that are similar to organisms and other animals. That is, they seek the easiest path to satisfaction of needs and emotions, and avoid effort and thought whenever possible. This is particularly true of individuals subjected to prolonged government propaganda campaigns. Government cannot force one to be successful, but it can set up conditions promoting irrationality and failure, as the U.S. has done. The best antidote to predictable government irrationality is to place individuals back in touch with reality, that is, with the true effects of their decisions. Despite Ariely's faulty analysis, hedoes unwittingly show the many ways in which government directly and indirectly promotes irrationality."

I ask that you please make the ultimate judgement.<br />OVERVIEW<br />My book, the Princess Diana Conspiracy, has sold well and convinced many people about Diana being murdered; this hasn't pleased MI6. They tried to prevent my book from reaching the US market by sending my first book shipment back to the UK. Amazon.com was also later persuaded that my book was made of ""hazardous materials""; this prevented it's availability around the time I was on four US TV shows and five US radio shows in September which was a critical time for my book's exposure. I also appeared on the Geraldo at Large show in New York and wasn't told I would be met by Imogen Lloyd Webber (MI6) who tried hard to debunk my views. Now MI6 recruit a failed author to assist them.<br />MI6 use Morgan's services because he is more concerned about money than justice for Diana. He has written several boring, disastrous books and has latched onto ""The Princess Diana Conspiracy"" to advertise them. He wrote his ""review"" based on his flawed opinions, not facts. Despite acknowledging that the inquests evidence is corrupt, he uses this same material to debunk my book and to write all of his own books; it is all he has. How anyone can write an account of what happened to Diana by using this same corrupt evidence and without challenging it, escapes me. MI6 had ten years to sanitize evidence and Morgan's views reflect the inquests findings, thus showing that he supports MI6.<br />I show that a huge number from Morgan's list of my supposed ""errors"" are either complete nonsense, his ignorance of the pre inquest evidence or his own baseless opinions. Morgan suggests his opinionsare indisputable and other ""errors"" are what he calls my ""Power Constructs""; these are where he doesn't accept the evidence I present because he doesn't possess it. All are my supposed ""errors"" and a large number of examples are shown in the PDF. Morgan didn't start looking into the details about this vile crime until 2006. I began in 2003 so I use this pre inquest evidence to challenge the evidence that emerged from the inquest. Morgan perversely extolls the inquest evidence whilst also stating it is corrupt.<br />He attacks me by saying that ""All investigative books-I include my own-have some errors. That is not the issue. The issue here is the level and type of error"". So he pins the justification for his attack not on any errors but on the level and type of my supposed errors that apparently indicate I am working with MI6 (I am not). So, if you are content that the examples I show in the PDF illustrate Morgan's point is rubbish, and you may even regard his comments as pathetic, you will clearly see his purpose.<br />This was not a labour of love but done out of necessity. If we are to have justice and bring the truth to light then I need to clarify Morgan's purpose and send him to your mercy; not of my choice. Please find the time to read the full review on my web and take your own stance. Don't let this man pervert the course of justice now when my book takes us so close. Demand justice for Diana, Princess of Wales and deny MI6 their hard fought for victory.<br />PDF FOLLOWS ON WEB<br /> (I did make mistakes in The Princess Diana Conspiracy and have apologised. But these genuine errors were corrected and published as an eBook three weeks before Morgan's corruption emerged so his pathetic comments about my MI6 association and raising false flags etc., by deliberately giving out false information, are proven untruths; he knew I was pursuing justice. I had already corrected the genuine errors earlier so clearly wasn't trying to laya false trail. Please understand this point because it's the bedrock of Morgan's excuse for his corruption and proves this man is a criminal. I have now finished a review of my entire book and it is being typeset; it will be with the printers next week and also an update will be sent for the eBook. I shall also be extra careful when I send the files to the printers this time to ensure they arrive intact-more later.)"

I got busy and failed to collect 60 PDUs and recently had to sit for the exam again. I was never crazy about Rita's book but when I took the test it was my only option. This time I did a lot of research to find out the best PMP book in the market which not only will help the reader to pass the test but also help them understand real life project management with case studies and scenarios. Below is my finding:    Professor Sohel: This book is the best in every possible way. It is written in a language that anyone can understand and mostly every concept is explained with examples. It has summary tables after every topic which is simply spectacular, questions are exactly what you will see in real life exam, extremely structured and well organized. Loved this book.

The author chose not to use quotation marks which seemed weird to me, especially with so much inner dialogue. Sometime I didn't know if the main character was speaking or thinking and had to re-read in several spots.  It just seems lazy to me and I don't understand why someone would use this format. That's not why I'm giving the book 2 stars though. The author seemed to create a fairly realistic world, but then totally dropped the ball in several spots.  For instance it seemed like nearly every character spoke like a redneck. Maybe the author is implying that only the rednecks will survive... Ha ha, but I don't know. The girl, a 15 year old that can't even remember what the world was like before it all happened leads me to believe it's been at least 10 years, yet she is able to find cheese crackers on a shelf in a store. I'm pretty sure that after 10 years there would be no food on the shelf and it certainly wouldn't be eatable. She was also fortunate to find Coke in a few occasions. Never Pepsi or Dr. Pepper.  The most unrealistic thing about the book was that she was driving all over the country filling up her gas tank whenever she ran low.  I found this totally unbelievable since most gas stations would be empty after 10 hours, but here she is 10 years later.  Anyway, the story was just okay, I liked the 15 year old girl and even cheered for her. Several characters I could see clearly in my mind.

It's devastating for many children (and adults). Most people who suffer from depression and bipolar disorder have a fixation on the idea of eternal pain.<br /><br />Fear of Hell is the price most Christians pay for accepting the promises of Jesus. You can't have one without the other. This book focuses on the culmination of Jesus' threats. There is another book that describes the lifelong affect those threats have on a young man. It serves well as counterpoint to ""Hell Is for Real.""<br /><br />""How to Stop Believing in Hell"" is the autobiography of a very peculiar person who tries to commit the unforgivable sin to escape the threats of Jesus. In it the author describes the messes he gets into trying to rid himself of his decades long fear of Hell. The story should interest similarly peculiar people among many others.<br /><br />""How to Stop Believing in Hell"" starts with a barrage of shocking blasphemies once shouted by the author at the lunch-breaking denizens of the Congressional office buildings in Washington,, D.C. After a series of adventures, the author reconciles himself with God, who delivers him from his conscience and every other vestige of morality. The author is then free to commit suicide, a fate he has longed for since childhood. In the end the happy author is ""a man on a ledge enjoying the fresh air."""

There isn't much between the stories mr Roberts is producing now and the best from Saddler.<br /><br />Just like to point out that Mattias is such a great character, the best in any of the Roberts era, bar casca himself obviously.<br /><br />I vaguely remember someone saying in an earlier review that mr Roberts tried to make casca seem like a '1970s touchy feely guy'.. I think this book is more than enough to dismiss that claim as pure ignorance and retardedness.<br /><br />Excellent work mr Roberts, keep it up!!"

I don't remember how much detail the author gave on nootropics but it was after reading this book I began my quest to sharpen my mind and improve my overall cognitive functioning.  This book is inspiring as it is factual, in my opinion.<br /><br />Besides following the exercises clearly outlined in this book, I also began researching and eventually taking a combination of nutritional supplements called nootropics (i.e. piractem, aniracetam, etc).  They were first discovered 30+ years ago and were used to treat serious medical conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ADHD.  Then after scientists began recommending them as cognitive enhancers to the public, they started to become a very popular brain supplement.<br /><br />They are a very intriguing family of supplements.  My suggestion to anyone looking to improve their brain function is to look into some type of natural brain supplement, everyone is different so do your own research like I did and decide for yourself if it's a good idea.  Besides experimenting with a few nootropics, I've been taking ginseng and ginko for years, [[ASIN:B009K30D28 Ginseng Complex Plus Royal Jelly (1000 Mg) + FREE Ginkgo Biloba Extract (30 Mg) 60 Tablets]].

The characters are as real in this story as I'm sure they are in the author's experience. Their portrayal reminded me of the characters from my own travels and the characters in my current classroom; most importantly, they evoked real emotion.<br /><br />Frustration, pride, loneliness, disappointment, and elation are feelings that I believe anyone who has traveled or taught can relate to. These are circumstances of so much good and so much unknown. While reading Abbey's story, I felt 23 again--I remembered the realization that teaching was way more then theory--I remembered feeling so hopelessly out of place in a foreign country that I wanted to disappear--I remembered the freedom that comes with embarking on an adventure--and I remembered how often the resolutions of change come throughout a lifetime.<br /><br />It's hard to graduate college and find your place in a grown up world. It's hard to move away from home. It's hard to know yourself well enough to predict where you will be at the end of every road.

Lonely Planet really gets into a country in their guides. The don't fill their pages with glossy color photos, though a few would be nice, instead their pages are full of information.<br /><br />They have maps to everywhere you'd want to go in a country. They do the cities justice as well as the countryside. They do the markets and the beaches, the churches and the museums, the bike trails and the footpaths.<br /><br />I believe a trip to Thailand should include a side tour to Vietnam, at least mine is going to, so both books are a necessity to me. The book on Thailand is over 800 pages and its writers write as if they've lived there, as if they really know the country. A different group of writers have written the Vietnam book and that surprised me, because I though some of them would have worked on both books. Nevertheless, though it's 250 pages shorter than the Thailand book, the book on Vietnam is equally as well written.<br /><br />I should say that the print in these books is on the smallish side, but I suppose to make it any larger they'd have to have so many pagers that the books would be unwieldy, especially the Thailand book.<br /><br />I've always looked at Lonely Planet as catering to a different kind of clientele than Frommor's or Fodor's. Those two companies seem to cater more toward the traveler who has more to spend, who will more than likely stay in the more expensive hotels. Sure you'll find the expensive hotels in Lonely Planet as well, but you'll find a myriad of less expensive alternatives. I believe you get more information about a country from Lonely Planet and I'm looking forward to going to Thailand and Vietnam and having Lonely Planet show me the way."

Azra is a smart, funny, caustic, bedeviling, and one-of-a-kind character rarely seen in YA.<br /><br />When the silver bangle is clasped around her wrist that provides this power, it's the final straw in a lifetime fighting the inevitable servitude that this precious gift will truly entail. Azra descends from a long line of Jinn -- what we refer to as genies -- and a strong incident in her past has turned her away from magic, her Jinn heritage, and her Zar sisters. Finally unable to escape, Azra is faced with the dilemma of becoming Jinn in a world of humans who she must hide her powers from and yet live among, including the terrific and self-depreciating Henry across the street and her lifeguard crush Nate. Azra must navigate the increasingly complicated world she now inhabits, learning magic, hiding her true self from her friends, and avoiding the Afrit, who rule over the Jinn and keep the wish-granting Jinn and their mothers separated from the males. As Azra's first-person tale unfurls, the author is able to demonstrate the frustration, fear, and confusion we all faced as teenagers and journeyed toward adulthood, jockeying for position, affections, and our rightful place, all with Azra's wry sense of humor and wit, which punctuates the book throughout. The book builds momentum to an unstoppable pace, beginning with Azra's birthday, through her wish-granting, and ultimately to the incidents that bring her full circle in her journey of accepting being Jinn. Barreling to the end, you will finish demanding that book 2 be released much sooner than April 2016!<br /><br />This is a triumphant debut by an author with a particular talent for creating believable and relatable characters, accurate dialog, and terrific turns of phrase. Even if the author wasn't my wife, I would recommend the book to anyone who loves good characters, humor, and a well-executed tale."

There were lots of points through the book where I found things out that I probably should have known but had never quite understood.<br />I also liked the way the software engineering focus to writing code in a style suitable for large applications.<br />The overview of the client side data storage APIs is the area I probably learned the most (I had really only heard of these before - never used them) and will definitely use these in the future.<br />I also learned a lot I didn't know about the new Javascript APIs around files and web workers.<br />The web application developed through the book is relatively simplistic - it would have been nicer if it was slightly more complex - but probably it was sufficient for demonstrating the subjects of the book.<br />Overall I would recommend for intermediate and senior programmers - but anyone new to Javascript may want to buy a beginners book first.

He has now returned the favor by encapsulating his experience as a young man growing up in that environment and makes no apologies; not that any is required.<br /><br /> ""A Place Called Gouyave, is a masterfully well written book by Collis DeCoteau. He brought to the forefront, a time capsule that encompasses the liveliness of a people; their effervescent culture; their exuberance and their warmth which is and continues to be the foundation of our Gouyave people.<br /><br />In the only way it could have been written, DeCoteau's short stories reminded us of a culture that is commonly shared all over our Caribbean Islands on a grander scale but presented with that unique Gouyave flavor that he willingly shares. Yet, his book leaves room for a learning moment among the more sophisticated readers who seek to understand the foundation of our Caribbean people in general.<br /><br />It is a must read that will surely bring a smile to your faces especially as you reminisce about your own youthful experiences.<br /><br />-Vernon Louison"

The author uses real-life examples, cases, and scientific and psychological experiments to demonstrate just how susceptible our justice system is to human fallibility.  In one of the early chapters, for example, he uses the tragic case of David Rosenbaum, the award-winning New York Times journalist, to highlight how one mistaken assumption (that David was passed out because he was drunk - not because he had been struck and mugged, which was the reality) led to a series of oversights by police and medical professionals.  Once the mistake was realized, it was too late, and David died from head injuries.  However, as soon as his identify was known, as a respected and well -known writer, the biases swung in his favor - the perpetrator was identified, convicted and sentenced harshly.  Reforms to emergency and police procedures were passed in D.C., certainly tied to the victim's prominent and respected social standing.<br /><br />The book goes on to make sense of the seemingly irrational nature of false confessions; present the actual differences in &#34;normal&#34; and criminal brains; expose the predictability of cheating - from students to prosecutors; explore the unreliable nature of memory; discuss the obvious but oft overlooked fact that judges are humans, too! And the list goes on.<br /><br />I've never written a book review, but I felt compelled to do so for this book.  It is not only fascinating, but an extremely important subject that affects us all.  By educating ourselves about the science that dictates our every single thought and action, we can better understand how our justice system should be designed to ensure it can actually serve its purpose.  The book presents a number of easy first steps - some already being implemented - that can minimize the affect our biases have on the justice system - and also digs deeper, pushing the reader to grapple with the very nature of criminal behavior and how we as a society have been taught to view it.  I would highly recommend this interesting, enjoyable and important book."

I am, and have always been, a city dweller.  My dad did not leave when I was small.  I was not raised by my mother and grandmother.  I am old enough for Sowers to be my son.  One would assume Sowers and I have little in common except our gender.  However, I like real stories about real people.  The stories Sowers tells are real.  Sowers is &#34;real.&#34;  He opens his heart and soul, holds nothing back; his fears, failures, shortcomings, doubts, thoughts.  He puts it all &#34;out there.&#34;  No, actually he brings you &#34;in there,&#34; into his real life, his real feelings, his real everything.  As Sowers permitted me to be a part of his private life, I found myself going in a different direction.  Although I started the journey in to his mind and heart, I found myself walking a different path, my path, my past, my life, my heart, my soul, my failures, my fears, my shortcomings, my questions, deep personal and spiritual questions. At one point I stopped, closed the book, meditated about what I have just read and wondered, &#34;How could someone so &#34;young&#34; have so much insight, wisdom and thoughts that are supposed to occur when you are my age!?  Reflecting upon the book, I have concluded Sowers had some help; divine I suspect.  Although there no &#34;preachy&#34; words or phrases anywhere in the book, make no doubt about it, the book is deeply spiritual.  It comes from a place deep within a writer who obviously has a genuine connection to the Source from which he draws much of what makes this book so special, so relevant, so personal and so vital.  I frankly think his book has something for every man, the best book of its type since Wild At Heart.  But this one will take you deeper within yourself than Wild At Heart.  I am curious to see how the book resonates with a the fairer gender."

Wicks moves perspectives from psychology to spirituality in a way that doesn't quite mesh well, and as noted, the message gets a little redundant - which may belie both the simplicity and difficulty of the task at hand - namely the management and elimination of the head trash that holds us back from personal and professional growth.

Ian Buruma sets out to write a history of that year; but more than that - he examines the aftermath of the war. Little known facts and incidents populate this book, even if one has been a frequent reader of this time period's history. At points a reader can be caught off guard by some of the comparisons. The celebration of VE Day is compared to Beatle mania. The structure of his writing can also be confusing in places. He writes about Germany and then in the next sentence of Japan, without a comparison or a break in the organization.<br /><br />Much of the study is not so much about the rebuilding after the war, but the horrors still inflicted on the people that survived and their fight to survive the peace. Even rations were cut in Britain after the armistice. The retributions of soldiers and civilians, the rejection of soldiers returning by friends and relatives are examined. We learn of graves opened in the search for valuables and gold teeth, and dead crows for sale for food. This is not really the reconstruction, but the roadblocks that came after the war.<br /><br />This is a hard read, to know of the killings and revenge that fill its pages. It is, in many places a tough view of human behavior; but we also see the very hard attempts to bring the shattered countries and people back to a semblance of normal life. There is an outstanding analysis of the British electorates' rejection of Churchill.<br /><br />Still, even with the choppiness in some of the writing and of various sentence structures; this is still a must read for those who wish to learn of the time after WWII and the attempt to make peace, despite the terrors many faced. Those interested in history would do well to put this on their reading list."
10665,10666,__label2__,5,N,Books,1423184629,Far From You,Great book for fans of Veronica Mars.,"Sophie Winters is a drug addict. Everyone knows that, but no one will believe that she's been clean for over six months, ever since her parents sent her to her aunt's for a tough love DIY rehab. But no matter what she says, no one believes the OXY pills--- the pills they found in her coat the night she and her best friend Mina walked into the woods together and only Sophie made it out alive --- aren’t hers. With everyone from her parents to Mina's brother believing that Mina was shot at a drug deal gone bad, it's up to Sophie to find the real motive and the real killer.<br /><br />But as she solves the case, Sophie has other issues to deal with, like the combined grief of her best friend's death and the knowledge that though they were both in love, Mina would have never agreed to be with her openly. Complicating things is her attraction to Mina's brother, who has always loved her and is responsible for the car accident that left her in permanent pain and led to her pill addiction. Joining forces with the strange but kind home-school kid who found her and Mina, Mina's ex-boyfriend and Mina's brother, Sophie begins to uncover the cold case that will lead her to solve two town murders.<br /><br />FAR FROM YOU is one part murder mystery, one part painful love story. Told in chapters that alternate between the present and the three most important times of her life --- the car crash, her pill addiction, and Mina's shooting --- it leaves plenty of mysteries unsolved until the final chapters. Sharpe does a great job as painting Sophie's love for Mina as another kind of addiction, an ever-present force in her life she could never really be free of, even as it was hurting her.<br /><br />FAR FROM YOU is a great book for fans of Veronica Mars, yet easily sets itself apart from the trend of YA murder mysteries with its unique love triangle and authentic voice of a teen dealing with addiction.<br /><br />Reviewed by Molly Horan on April 9, 2014."
10668,10669,__label2__,2,Y,Books,1934554499,Large Family Logistics,Not For Me,"I was expecting to like this book much more than I did. There was some practical stuff in the book, but not as much as I would have hoped. This book presents the husband as the authority in the house. In all areas. At all time. Kitchen needs to be remodeled? Husband decides how. Kids need new homeschool curriculum? Ask Dad what he want them to learn. It isn't presented as keeping the husband involved in the goings on of the family or weighing his opinions with yours, it always comes across as you ask him what he wants and then you make it happen. I don't view my role of wife and mother in that way. That is not what submission says to me. That sounds an awful more like slavery than submission. (All the responsibility with zero authority.) It was very hard for me to get passed this aspect of the book. Even when I tried to overlook it, I'd come across her advice that was really more of a personal preference than actual wisdom. She prefers jumpers. (As in those overall type dresses that were popular in the early 90s.) I can get just as much mothering done in my jeans and t-shirt, thank you very much. That is a personal preference. There is nothing holy or even helpful about jumpers. There was plenty of this type of thing sprinkled throughout the book. I was also a bit surprised that the publishers chose the textbook style of printing. It just didn't seem to be a textbook style book of any kind, so the choice of printing was strange to me.<br /><br />Overall, I don't recommend the book. Want something better and along the same lines?

10678,10679,__label2__,4,N,Books,1878424076,Seth Speaks: The Eternal Validity of the Soul,Can anyone please check the dog pound?,"Together with ""The Seth Material"", ""Seth speaks"" is the most well-known book featuring Seth starring himself. Apparently, this book pretty much started the New Age channelling craze. Seth is a multi-dimensional, spiritual personality from another plane of existence, who periodically speaks through the mouth of medium Jane Roberts (whom he calls Ruburt).<br /><br />Now, that sentence should really be in the past tense, since Roberts is deceased, but Seth claims that time doesn't really exist, so I might as well speak in the present tense, wouldn't you agree?<br /><br />I tend to avoid channelled material, but the few items I somehow managed to sift through were quite different from ""Seth speaks"". This book blends incredibly dense, pseudo-philosophical and boring prose with a strange and much welcome sense of humour. In general, the channelled spirits seem to take themselves far too seriously! Seth makes slips of the tongue (at one point forgetting the number of chapters he has dictated), has a love-hate relationship with cats, claims to have lost his dog somewhere on our planet, and seems fond of beer! He also insists on starting every other sentence with the words ""Now"". At one point he jokingly refers to himself as a ghostwriter...<br /><br />As for Seth's message, it's another version of New Age thinking - I sometimes wonder how many versions there might be out there?<br /><br />God isn't a person, but an ever-evolving Consciousness, referred to by Seth as All That Is. Time as we know it doesn't exist. An almost infinite number of alternate realities co-exist simultaneously. (In some parallel universe, Seth's dog presumably wasn't taken by the dog-catcher.) Strictly speaking, reincarnation therefore doesn't exist either, since all our ""previous lives"" exist at the same time. We are all multi-dimensional personalities, living on many different planes of existence, constantly evolving in innumerable directions. We are also somehow part of God, who is the ultimate multi-dimensional entity. Weirdly for a system that lacks time, All That Is nevertheless evolves and constantly creates new forms. This is, of course, impossible for us puny mortals to comprehend. Everything that happens to us is created by ourselves. Our consciousness creates our reality, whether good, bad or ugly. Our material world with all its suffering is a mass hallucination. We should all learn and evolve.<br /><br />Since everything is an illusion suspended in a timeless Now (pun intended), it's difficult to see the point of the exercise. How can you learn and evolve within an illusion where everything exists simultaneously? At various points in ""Seth speaks"", our friend tends to mellow his message somewhat. I have already pointed out that All That Is apparently evolves despite there not being any time, and it would seem that our existence in some sense isn't completely illusory, after all. As for suffering and evil, Seth concedes that suffering doesn't necessarily have to exist, that we suffer due to our unevolved state, and that the point of suffering is to teach us to overcome suffering - a somewhat softer view than that taken by, say, Dolores Cannon (see my previous review on this plane of existence). Still, when it comes to the philosophical points about time, space, matter and consciousness, I would say that a few books by David Ray Griffin might do Seth some good...<br /><br />Seth also says a few scandalous things about Jesus. Is anyone surprised? Apparently, Jesus was part of a broader personality incarnating as three distinct human beings: John the Baptist, Jesus and Paul. In 2075, Paul will return. This is tantamount to the Second Coming. Seth is unsure about the crucifixion. At one point, he seems to be suggesting that the entire Gospel stories are dramas and dreams, ""real"" on a psychic level but not in any material-historical sense. At another point, he spins a scenario similar to the Muslim one, only more weird. (Of course, the Muslim traditionsabout Jesus are in themselves warped versions of the Gnostic ""laughing saviour"".) Apparently, Jesus got away. Judas deliberately ""betrayed"" the wrong man to the authorities, a poor deluded crackpot who thought he was the Christ and absolutely wanted to be crucified. In drugged condition, this substitute was indeed executed by the Romans. His body was stolen by some of the disciples in the dead of night (hence the empty tomb). The real Jesus then appeared to the disciples, who therefore believed he had been resurrected. In reality, he was still alive and well in his physical body. Ah, what evangelical heresy-hunters could do with this!<br /><br />Does Seth really exist? At one point, our ghostwriter comes close to conceding that he doesn't: ""This voice is only used as a symbol of the energy and the strength that is available to each of you, as you utilize those abilities that are your heritage"". A similarity to other channelled material is the amount of historical references which makes no sense. Seth believes in Atlantis. He expounds at length on an underground civilization called Lumania, whose inhabitants were so fearful and shy that they made up the fierce warrior god Jehovah as a protector. Seth claims to have been a certain 4th century pope, but no such pope is recorded by history. More damningly, Seth claims that a Muslim Arab he once met wavered between faith in Allah and faith in Moses - an absurd proposition. Presumably, Seth or Ruburt have mixed up Allah with Muhammad! But even that is absurd, since Muslims recognize Moses as a prophet. Somebody should send Seth a book by Huston Smith on comparative religion, c/o Lumania.<br /><br />Part of my own multi-dimensional personage wants to believe that Seth is a real being and even help him find that poor dog of his (probably a Newfie). The other part feels that Seth is simply a part of Jane Roberts' earthly personality. He doesn't say anything that's *really* out of the ordinary compared to what every other Theosophist, kabbalist or esotericist has already said - except those parts that can be checked and disproved. But then, I suppose followers of Seth could claim that their beloved entity really did get some things completely wrong. In contrast to many other purported spirit guides, Seth is strangely unassuming.<br /><br />Despite the humour, I can't say ""Seth speaks"" is an easy read. It's repetitive, long-winding and often really boring. But yes, it could be of some interest to scholars of comparative religion or new agey seekers. One sure wonders how the contemporary spiritual scene would have looked like, had more entities like Seth been channelled by the Neo-Theosophical faithful? Imagine a conversation between Seth and Osho!<br /><br />Now, I'm not sure how to rate ""Seth speaks"", but finally I decided to play it nice and give our dog-loving, beer-sipping and vaguely Islamophobic ghostwriter three and a half stars."
10762,10763,__label2__,5,N,Books,1612183123,Trail of Dead (Scarlett Bernard),"Great Characters, Excellent Story","Trail of Dead is the second Scarlett Bernard Novel.  I read and reviewed the first novel, Dead Spots, in October of 2012.<br /><br />Sometimes a second book is a let down.  That is not true of Trail of Dead.  If anything it is even better that Dead Spots.  One of the things that struck me this time was how two different authors can take the same premise and write books that are completely different.  In the Alexia Tarabotti novels by Gail Carriger Alexia can negate supernatural powers or when near vampires and werewolves they become normal humans.  Scarlett does the same but the stories and characters are completely different.  The fact that it took me two books to even make the comparison is proof of that.<br /><br />The world building was done in Dead Spots.  The main characters are the same. Jesse, Scarlett and Eli are all part of the story but the focus has moved from Jesse and Eli to Scarlett.  Trail of Dead builds from the foundation laid in Dead Spots.  Again the writing is excellent, the plot well developed, the characters well drawn and tension builds to a satisfying conclusion.  Again, there were some unexpected twists and turns.  This book was based on a problem character from book one.  That character is now gone.  Trail of Dead could be the last Scarlett Bernard Novel but I am hoping that I saw a small set up for the next book.  I will certainly be on the look out and hoping that the series will continue.<br /><br />Trail of Dead is scheduled for publication June 4, 2013.  I received an advanced reader's copy review copy of Trail of Dead from Amazon Vine.  You should pre-order your copy now."

Having said that, this is a book review - not a review of Scott Walker - so I've downscaled it to 4 stars based on the book itself.  The book discusses the challenges and controversy of passage of Act 10 in Wisconsin, as well as many other reforms instituted by Walker and the Republican majority in response to a budget crisis in 2010.  The book lags and repeats in spots, but is generally well written and easily read.  His principles and approach are well documented, and his positions as well as prescriptions are well articulated at a macro-level.  The book coveys the palpable tension of the 2011 protests and their aftermath.  As Walker begins to contemplate a run for President in 2016, it is important to be informed - and this book will give you some insights into the man and his methods."

It's about a 12 year old girl named Willow who looks and acts different from typical girls her age. She's a genius but the quirks don't stop there. She gets joy out of counting by sevens and is obsessed with medical symptoms and diagnoses of diseases. After disaster strikes, Willow has to find a way to cope with the motley group of people she unexpectedly finds herself among.<br /><br />This book has all the making of a Newbery gold medalist: strong character development, a lovable and unique protagonist, a death (but it happens early so it's not a depressing book), well written prose and unexpected hilarious moments interspersed. I really enjoyed it and hope it gets at least some recognition by way of awards.<br /><br />That said, even though I think it's an excellent book, I am dubious that the target age group would enjoy it. The beginning is slow and, due to the early death, was hard to get into. There were days I didn't want to pick it up because I didn't want to read about grieving. Once I got past that, I was eager to open its pages. But I can't help but think that adolescents would not be as tenacious with their reading. Also, there aren't any heart-racing moments where the excitement peaks. This is a book to savor and to relish, not to grip with white knuckled fingers at 2am.<br /><br />But personally for me, an adult, I was enchanted by it and am glad to have read it.<br /><br />P.S I know I mentioned the death but since the product description mentions it, I didn't consider it a spoiler."

10849,10850,__label2__,1,N,Books,761452915,Exiled: Memoirs of a Camel,"a bit mature for children, and heavy on Islam indoctrination","I was torn on how to review this book. On one hand, the book is a page turner, but as a children's book (or at least children's reading level), it's hard not to be a page-turner... on the other hand, the references to the Q'uran and Allah were nearly on every single page. It was over the top. I do not have a problem with children being exposed to other cultures or other religions - but this was not exposure - this was non-stop praise for Allah. Each chapter opens with a quote from the Q'uran and nearly every page has either a person or a camel praising Allah. I don't know if it was put in there to try to add realism to the story, but it was so emphasized, it made itself way too obvious. It was a distraction to the story. I was interested in reading this book when I read the description because of the history of the US Camel Corps. I had never heard of this experiment in American history and was intrigued by the story. The camels were captured and sold in Egypt to the US government - so I get the names they used - many of which were the authentic names of actual camels and people involved in the Camel Corps. The camels bowing to pray to Allah was a bit much. Even without the non-stop indoctrination (seriously - nearly every page), the content was a bit intense for young readers. The book is listed as for grades 4-8. Even without addressing the all-Allah-all-the-time references, the subject matter seems to be beyond what I'd feel comfortable with even a 7th grader reading. Camels mating, camels killing each other, and the Egyptian cameleer anxious to go into town to get to the prostitutes. Seriously? I'm not sure what the editors were thinking and why they didn't rein some of this in. The story of the US Camel Corps is one that needs to be told - I just think there's a better way to tell this story to young children. When looking at the book as a whole - it's goal to tell the story to children, it fails as it is too mature and heavy on religious indoctrination - whether or not that was the intent of the author."

A few hours later, Emma learns that Joanna's daughter Lainey is in a mental health facility after three attempts to commit suicide.  Lainey and Emma's own daughter are good friends, so Emma pays the young woman a visit.  After the talk, Emma thinks that a ghost might be involved in Lainey's attempts on her own life.  But is it Max or someone else?  Can Emma figure out the cause in time to keep Lainey safe?  I've enjoyed the previous two books in this series, and this was the strongest yet.  The characters, both living and ghostly, are vivid and pull you into the story.  There were times some of the characters were doing some stupid things, but even then I usually felt sorry for them.  The plot moves forward on two levels involving the present and the past.  Both mysteries are compelling, although I usually found myself more involved in the modern mystery.  Yet the historic mystery packed a real emotional punch in the end.  There was a sub-plot I didn't like because Emma was being stupid and complicating her life.  I'll be looking forward to seeing how that gets resolved in future books.  This is a compelling read with great characters that will keep you turning pages until you reach the end."

Now some have the colors of birds (or lizards), feathers and other structures that are considered more useful for mating displays than any other purpose.

There are 12 chapters in this book (plus an introduction). The chapters take differing looks at the linkage of inequality with democracy. Some are more qualitative, others more quantitative. There is even an effort to use quantitative techniques to analyze Athenian democracy!<br /><br />One of the more interesting chapters is an essay by Edward Muller, in which he statistically analyzes the relationship on inequality to democracy (chapter 5). In several tables reported in this chapter, he finds that greater inequality is associated with lower scores on a democracy index across countries. Another chapter (by Ember, Ember, and Russett) indicates that greater inequality goes with less voice from citizens.<br /><br />Other chapters take a more exotic approach.<br /><br />However, in the end, this is a fascinating, although somewhat idiosyncratic work, on an important subject."

If you read the first book first, then the second book is better.

It's now a must-have for my gluten-free cooking!,"With 2 members of the family who are gluten-free,  I'm always searching for new and innovative recipes. Whether you're experienced or are new to gluten-free cooking, this book would be among my top 3 choices - not only for the recipes ( you can check out the ones I tested and the results below) but some unique special features. There are instructions on how to prepare several special flour mixes.. There is also comprehensive information about many  other aspects of gluten-free living. This is an impressive resource.    A major asset of this book are the instructions for creating  3 special baking flour blends, each with special advantages. There is the Basic Gluten-Free All-Purpose Homemade Flour Blend. Then there is  a High- Protein and Fiber All Purpose flour blend as well as another option-  a High-Protein, Low -Glycemic Flour blend.     These special mixes do NOT appear on any store shelves and are only in this book.    Listed below are the results of a round of testing recipes and the results.  Below that is a section on the special features of this book. The author is an active member of the advisory board of the Celiac Disease Program at Children's National Medical Center as well as the executive editor of Delight Gluten-Free magazine.    I do think it is important to note that if you are following a low-calorie or low-fat diet, you will need to keep a CLOSE eye on the calorie and fat counts per serving. Many are high. Even so, I found that by making a few simple substitutions . I could  lower calories and fat to acceptable levels. However, the recipes I tested for this review have NOT been altered or tweaked from the original instructions.     Also, there are a fair number of recipes here that are reasonably low in calories. These include: Veggie Pizza, Crab and Oyster Mushroom Bisque, Gazpacho salad, Spiced Kale Chips, Stuffed Mushrooms (Lemon, Ricotta and Kale filling)    On to the recipes:    Here's what we made on Day 1: We started with Herbed Hummus, anice mixture of garbanzo beans, tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, basil leaves, cilantro leaves, parsley, chives, and garlic. It was incredible, eaten on its own or served with gluten-free crackers. This is a recipe which is easily tweaked a bit so if you hate cilantro, as some do, add a bit more parsley or adjust to taste. We followed the recipe just as written. We devoured it within an hour.     Next on the agenda? Another appetizer, Baked Potato Chips with Parsley, Garlic and Sea Salt. This is an easy snack recipe to prepare and clean-up is minimal, especially if you have parchment paper on hand to line the baking sheets (as recommended by the author) These chips could also be a side dish with dinner. They had a nice depth of flavors, and the simple additions of garlic and parsley were just the right touches. You can modify this one easily to accommodate your favorite spices.     Moving on to dinner: we made Green Beans with Tomatoes, Garlic, and Onions. We had fresh green beans and tomatoes waiting to be used. It took less than 15 minutes to pull this one together (not counting time to remove the ends from the fresh green beans) . Fresh green beans, onions, garlic and a touch of red pepper flakes. Delish!    Then came Pan- Seared Chicken Cutlets with Mushroom Gravy. Took minutes to make and the gravy turned simple  chicken cutlets into a gourmet dish.    We wanted a simple dessert for the meal's finish so we went with the Flan de Coco, easily made with staple ingredients found in our refrigerator and pantry. Very satisfying.     We didn't have time to cook many breads except for quick breads. The Peach Yogurt Quick Bread was a smash hit - as were the Oatmeal Pancakes and the Buttermilk Cheddar Breakfast Biscuits. I'm particularly interested in seeing how the sandwich bread turns out and will update this review then. To be honest, by the time we got to breads  I was feeling too tired to tackle more.    Special features of this cookbook: In addition to the standardinfo about foods which contain gluten, there is an extensive list of gluten-free ingredients, safe food additives, unsafe foods,etc. The info on Food Labeling Laws in the United States was helpful for me as well as special tips on ""Navigating the Grocery Store for Home Cooking"" ."

Of course, not all marinades work equally well with meat/fish/poultry, so Lucy Vaserfirer has made things all that much easier for us by recommending which critters (and which cuts) work best with each particular marinade.

The strips originally appeared in Doctor Who Magazine Issues 365-380 and the the 2007 Doctor Who Story Book.<br /><br />The Betrothal of Sontar (365-367): The first 10th Doctor comic book story and the titular story from this collection finds the Doctor on an arctic world where a bunch of deviations in the Sontarans have a base far from the action of the war and under the command of a purebred Sontaran who ends ups using the Doctor to find a doomsday weapon. This is actually the weakest story in the book. It's a Sontaran story where no one acts like a Sontaran. The purebed Sontaran has a mustache and sits around alone with his chest plate off revealing a hairy chest and wears fur shoulder pads. Even with a generic alien, this would be an average story. For bungling the Sontarans, it's a notch below that. Grade: D+<br /><br />The Lodger (368): The Doctor is stuck on Earth and living with Mickey for a spell. The story is fun and does a nice job putting the Doctor into a unique situation. Roberts would later take the idea of the comic and make it a TV script for the 11th Doctor. You'll find the barebones of the idea here but other than the Doctor being good at soccer, little of the plot crosses over. Grade: A-<br /><br />F.A.Q. (369-371): This is a story that actually is reminiscent of &#34;Fear Her&#34; (a story that aired in the same series as the comic strips),  so it's weird the magazine ran this one.  The story is better than &#34;Fear Her&#34; but the similarities are striking. At any rate, the Doctor and Rose arrive in a block where weird things are happening and people are disappearing and strange things start happening including mysterious disappearance and three boys being turned into trees. It all seems to center on a boy and is sister. This story twists around like a pretzel, it's very clever and rich with a lot of emotion, psychology, andmisdirection at work. The commentary in the back reveals the real life modeling of the characters which makes the story even more enjoyable. Great concept and really good execution. Grade: A<br /><br />The Futurists (372-374): This is the type of story you see in comics, audio, and novels, but never on the TV series as we have a story based on an obscure fact of history, sprinkle in sci fi and enjoy. In this case, the Doctor and Rose land in Italy between the Wars where the Futurists are beginning a movement that would become Italian fascism. An alien transports one of these Futurists back in time and gives him the chance to conquer the world. This is a wonderfully researched story that has several great twists in the final parts. Mike Collins art is great throughout the book (excepting some of the Sontaran designs in the first story of course.) but this is his best work in the book. I love his drawings of 1920s Italy and the clothing for the era is superb too. There's also a few nice humor bits sprinkled throughout.I loved Rose showing the psychic paper to an illiterate soldier. Grade: A+<br /><br />Interstellar Overdrive (375-376): The TARDIS lands on a tour ship featuring a zombified singer leading a band of misfit has-beens. Of course, there's a murder mystery and a few nice end-jokes. The Time Loop that's a big plot device for the cliffhanger is a bit weak as the Doctor and Rose remember everything which serves to expedite the time loop solution but also isn't really how those things should work. Still, this is a fun story. Grade: B+<br /><br />Opera of Doom (2007 Doctor Who Story Book): This story finds the Doctor taking Rose to the opera where strange things are afoot and an alien eats music. This is a story that's too short but that's really the fault of the BBC which demanded a shorter length to protect its Doctor Who Annual and that hurt this tale. It could have done with a few more pages, but it's okay as is with a nice comic and some good lines. Grade:B<br /><br />The Green Eyed Monster (DWM 377): In Rose's final comic story, writer Nev Fountain decided to play with the idea promoted by many that Rose and her crew were kind of poor and trashy where Rose's adventures with the Doctor and one adventure in particular are fodder for a Jerry Springereseque Daytime talk show. This strip not only gets Mickey in, but also Jackie and in a quiet unusual way. Fountain manages to gently poke fun at some of Doctor Who's tropes as an alien princess tells the Doctor, &#34;Our scientists have been mystified as to why our planet is solely populated by stunningly attractive with physical ages of eighteen to twenty.&#34; The strip does a lot in 10 pages, playing with Rose's jealousy of other women around the Doctor, perceptions of the Tyler family, and even works a riff of Peter Davison's famous line from the Fury of the Deep. Nicely done. Grade: A<br /><br />The Warkeeper's Crown: The only visual teaming of the Brigadier and a revived series Doctor finds the Brigadier kidnapped from a Remembrance Day ceremony in full uniform. He arrives to find he's being asked to lead a war-like species into battle because he's the greatest military leader the Doctor knows. They also kidnap Mike Yates, however instead of the Brigadier's former UNIT aide, they kidnap a back bench member of parliament whose kind of petty. There are a few confusing points in the plot, but this is ultimately a love letter to the Brigadier and it works. It's a great dynamic between the post-time War Doctor and the Brigadier as the Brig realizes that the Doctor has been a war. Good stuff.  Also, a key moment from the Series 8 finale may have had its genesis in the last page of this comic. Grade: A-<br /><br />With the exception of the first story, I found most everything else in the book to be thoroughly enjoyable. There are some great concepts. Even though, many of these were planned with very little known of the 10th Doctor they captured the character well. Rose was usually pretty good, though she did occasionally become a bit of a comic foil. This is a very solid volume of comics from Doctor Who magazine that's a must read for fans of the 10th Doctor."

In this book, the ladies are in space.  Earth's space based defense agency (SWORD) is under attack after Deathbird is rescued.  A crazy group of gene-splicing aliens called the Providian Order have made custom bad guys out of Brood and Skrull warriors. They will stop at nothing to take Deathbird back with them.<br /><br />The Providian Order's minions aren't the only ones hunting Deathbird.  The Shi'ar become unlikely allies of the X-Men as Rachel Grey's family history collides with that of one of Shi'ar counselors.  I was glad to see Rachel's past getting a little more development in these issues because she is a strong character.<br /><br />These issues create a self-contained story, so readers can pick this volume up without reading the prior episode and they won't have to wait until the next installment for the conclusion.  This all-female has a great line up that includes Storm, Psylocke, and Rachel Grey, And the 'all-female' angle seems to promise something different for an X-team.  Unfortunately, the all-female team engages in pretty run-of-the-mill superhero adventures.  That is to say, while the premise of an all-female casts promises something unique, this comic delivers a pretty standard plot.<br /><br />If you like X-Men and especially if you like X-Women, this volume will appeal to you.  There is plenty of action and outer space excitement.  I keep waiting for that 'something special' that really defines a female x-team, but I never quite get it.  I will continue following this series because I really enjoy the characters and the idea behind the group has tremendous promise.

A recipe for the cake is on one page and the suggested filling recipe follows on the next. Of course the user is free to mix-up cakes and fillings but it is nice to have the basics follow in sequential order rather than chapters filled with nothing but cakes and some filled with nothing but fillings so the user must jump from one section to the next.  The book is a paperback so it doesn't lay open flat on the countertop. The use of a cookbook holder might be helpful. The ink color for the recipes and instructions is mercifully, black, so even with the small font size it is relatively easy to read. The paper quality is good and promptly wiped-up spills did not sink in and cause permanent damage. There is a solid index in the back so locating a particular recipe is easy. The measurements are given in grams and ounces. The majority of necessary ingredients are readily available in grocery stores, but golden syrup will require a search.  I made the Carrot Cake Whoopie pie along with the recommended Orange Mascarpone Cream filling. The combination was excellent and I won't hesitate to prepare it again, although I plan to try other varieties.  Recipes included in the Simple and Sweet section of the book are Chocolate with Fluffy Marshmallow filling, Mocha-Orange with Espresso cream filling, Pumpkin with Cream Cheese filling, Strawberry with Strawberry buttercream, Chocolate Chip with Chocolate Marshmallow cream, Carrot Cake with Orange Mascarpone cream, Lemon Cream with Lemon Curd cream, Red Velvet with Old Fashioned buttercream and Salty Caramel with Caramel Swiss buttercream.  Moving into the next few sections of the book the organization starts to drift a bit between icings, glazes, whoopie pie cakes, fillings and buttercreams. Recipes include, Teacake Whoopie, Chocolate icing, Kirsch Swiss buttercream, Rose-Pistachio Whoopie, Rosewater icing, Plain icing, Vanilla Swiss buttercream, Walnut Whip Whoopie, Meringue Whoopie, Chestnut cream, Coconut Cream Whoopie, Coconut Swiss buttercream, Coconut glaze, Raspberry and Nectarine Whoopie, Vanilla Bean cream, Raspberry Sauce, Blackberry Whoopie, Blackberry cream, Blackberry-Geranium sauce, Rhubarb & Custard Whoopie, Roasted Rhubarb, Banana Cream Whoopie, Chocolate Sauce and Shavings, Salty Caramel Sauce and Vanilla Custard Cream.  Recipes for Frozen and Chilled Whoopies where ice cream is used or an accompanying noted filling include, Oatmeal Cookie Whoopie (use vanilla ice cream,) Key Lime Whoopie, frozen Key Lime cream, Chocolate Mint Whoopie and frozen Mint Chip cream. Holiday treats include Christmas Cake Whoopie, Brown Sugar Spice buttercream, Spooky Halloween Whoopie, Easter Egg Whoopie and Multicolored Buttercreams.  Completely puzzling, at this point the book abandons its subject -- Whoopie Pies --and includes recipes for S'mores (yes, basic graham cracker, chocolate bar and toasted marshmallow s'mores,) Peanut Butter sandwich cookies with peanut butter filling, Easy Chocolate Macaroons, Chocolate-Caramel Ganache, Prize Peach Cobbler, Butterscotch Blondies and finally a Brownie Sundae.  The book's organization is a bit confusing and decisions like the inclusions in the last chapter simply strange, but the recipe I prepared was delicious and I look forward to trying more."

An intricately plotted story spanning loves, lives, and generations.

What a great novel this is! I don't want to give out any spoilers, so here is just a list of what you can expect to find in BELIEVING THE LIE:  - the novel is set mostly in Cumbria (although parts of it take place in London, too). I don't think Elizabeth George had written about Cumbria before this. I know how carefully this author researches the places where she sets the action of her novels, which makes you feel like you have actually visited Cumbria after you read this novel.  - there is a highly dysfunctional family in the centre of the narrative. This family's seemingly picture-perfect existence conceals a multitude of dark secrets. As always, George offers extremely convincing psychological insights into the personalities of her characters.  - in this novel, we see interactions between Barbara Havers and the wife of her neighbor who has returned to her husband and daughter. If you are a fan of the series and were shocked at how the last novel, THIS BODY OF DEATH, ended, I know that you must be dying to find out how this new set of circumstances plays out and how Barbara will deal with the presence of Azhar's wife so close to herself. By the way, Barbara is still working to improve her appearance, as she started doing in the last novel. The result is always comical and sad at the same time.  - Lynley and Isabelle Ardery continue to explore their mutual attraction, even though tensions grow between them. I imagine that many of the long-standing fans of the series are not exactly enamored of this plot line. However, we all have to recognize that George does everything to prevent the series from becoming stale. And she manages brilliantly to keep the interest of her readers at its peak.  - Deborah and Simon play an important part in this novel as they help Lynley conduct a covert investigation in Cumbria. They are going through yet another of the many crises their relationship has undergone over the years.  - Rodney Aronson, the sleazy tabloid reporter from IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ENEMY, appears in this novel, too. He is just as obsessed with finding scandalous stories and just as addicted to chocolate as he was before. George also introduces a hilarious character of a young Jewish reporter who is trying to please Rodney and find a stiry that would be juicy enough for the tabloid.  And there is a lot more to this great novel that is funny, mysterious, shocking, gripping and full of suspense, all at the same time. It always feels like one has to wait forever for Elizabeth George to release one of her new novels. However, the wait in the case of BELIEVING THE LIE was absolutely justified."

This 1998 book was written after the series ended. Jerry Seinfeld chose to end the series after nine years, it wasn't due to falling ratings. [The book says there was criticism about the stories.] This book covers Jerry's life from childhood to a national television star in 19 chapters. It has an `Episode Guide' to the 179 episodes and an `Index'. It tells about the stand-up comedians and the business of comedy in the 1980s. The show ran from May 1990 to May 1998. Was it ""a show about nothing"" as some said? It portrayed (or mocked) the lives of the personal servants of the rich and their problems. Did many of its audience identify with these characters and their problems? Did they know people like them? Or was it because it dealt with topics censored from the usual TV comedies? [I was not a fan and seldom watched the shows.]<br /><br />One example of its influence is on page 133 where an executive employee was fired for discussing an episode. A wrongful termination lawsuit awarded him $26 million. Euphemisms may work in a controlled TV show but have unwanted effects in the real world. Was this double-entendré part of the appeal of the show? Episodes dealt with the events of everyday life but looked at them from a humorous viewpoint. Can parking in a handicap-only spot generate humor? Its not funny to a handicapped person who needs that spot! Dealing with topics not usually discussed is certainly daring. It also dealt with ordinary problems, life finding your car in a huge parking garage. [Write down the location on a piece of paper.] It warned about the need to safeguard your financial records (""The Truth""). [Use a copying machine.]<br /><br />Jerry was born in 1954 and spent a lot of time watching TV (Chapter 1). [That TV station in NYC (p.3) now shows reruns of ""Seinfeld"" at night after prime time.] He graduated from Queens College in 1976 with a double major in theater and communication arts; then started as a stand-up comic (Chapter 2). The 1980s saw hundreds of comedy clubs started (Chapter 3). [There is a lot of details about the comedy business here.] Jerry appeared on ""The Tonight Show"" in 1981. His career grew (Chapter 4). He was a clean comic. Jerry could earn as much as ""the mid-five figures per week"" (p.48). Jerry built up a car collection (p.51). [Some inner hunger?] Jerry got together with Larry David to work on an NBC show about conversation (Chapter 5). Characters were based on people they knew. NBC ordered four more shows (p.63). Jerry's job as performer, producer, and writer was a heavy workload. The remaining fifteen chapters continue the story of this successful comedy show. Chapter 14 tells Jerry's idea of a perfect girlfriend. Read Chapter 15 for more details.<br /><br />Can this show ever be copied? For what reason? Shows are aimed at the 18 to 49 year olds because they have the most disposable income and spend their money more freely (p.111). Would you like these characters as neighbors or friends or co-workers? Too self-absorbed? What has changed after 15 years? Chapter 18 explains the economics of show business regarding salaries ad advertising. What does this say about the audience for TV shows?"

Centering crossed my path as &#34;centering prayer&#34; several years ago, and revolves around self awareness, stillness and connection as well as grounding.  Barsh crosswalks this meditative practice to an active implementation in &#34;Centered Leadership&#34;.<br /><br />The book begins with a useful introduction to centered leadership, and an introduction to the five components which make up the centered leadership facets:<br /><br />* Framing - self awareness, pausing and adaptability<br />* Connecting - Trust relationships, networks and community, sponsorships<br />* Engaging - Presence, ownership and taking risks and action<br />* Energizing - Energy balance, recovery and sustaining practices<br />* Meaning - Happiness, core strengths and purpose<br /><br />Barsh then walks the reader through each of the five elements, accompanied by a series of self reflective and team exercised designed to awaken and develop each of the five facets.  At the end, she hopes that he reader will have improved their leadership impact, self-fulfillment and resilience.<br /><br />Ultimately, the book is a useful tool - as much for self awareness and self development as to provide enlightening leadership techniques.  Barth seems to embrace the approach that to lead, one must first take care of themselves and understand (perhaps even &#34;center&#34;) themselves for maximum effectiveness.

All but one of their recommendations includes both cover art and a full page of the comic for the reader to consider.  If the series or graphic novel has won awards these are noted next before topics of an educational nature are listed along with a rare website that expands upon these often very basic life lessons.  ""Heads Up"" lists some issues that might concern some parents like name calling or violence or potty humor for example.  ""What's Next..."" suggests other comic books or graphic novels that touch upon the same themes or use the same genre.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised at the wide range of genres and the quality of artistry included in this guide.  Indeed the range is so great that I was surprised that some of these comic books or graphic novels were appropriate for this age range.  For example the ""My Boyfriend is a Monster"" series seem more for 9+ grade than 6-8 to me but perhaps we are pushing our girls to think about dating at earlier and earlier ages.  Likewise ""Bone"" was a shocker to see in these pages since we've always considered this a high school or adult graphic novel around my house.<br /><br />Regardless Robins and Wildsmith give us enough information to make an informed decision before we buy any of these for our children or children we know.

Coming away from this book, I can say that I love Shari Goldhagen's sense of the fragility of relationships and her empathy for often profoundly unsympathetic characters.  This is an author who lives for the cognitive dissonance experienced by all of us as we drift away from and sometimes back towards the people we see ourselves as truly being.  She has an exceptional ear for dialogue, which is probably at the top of my wish list for any writer.    I also feel like this novel must have been rushed to press or simply given up on at some point mid-rewrite.  There are contrivances that reek of coincidence, a science fiction conceit that might have actually paid off more satisfyingly had the author really taken a left turn very literally into another universe or two, and an already much-commented-on bit of weirdness where one character is addressed in the second person for reasons that remain entirely opaque.  If I'm just being dense about this last part, I'm clearly in good company.    And then there's the sex.  It's neither salacious nor gratuitous, but somehow jarring, particularly as concerns the character of Phoebe, who for awhile seems to be well on her way to being a fading-starlet-wannabee-turned-call-girl. There is a payoff of a sort with the setup, but with so many YA (""Young Adult"" genre) elements to this story, it feels somehow out of place, as does another character's very inappropriate youthful tryst with a stepparent. (One that could only have been characterized as abusive had the genders there been switched.)    A further bit of weirdness here is personal to me.  I chose this book for the blurb, which mentioned Orlando, FL, I believe, as well as Chicago (turns out to be more Skokie/Evanston), Los Angeles and Cincinatti.  I'm very familiar with three of these cities and have a passing acquaintance with the fourth.  I was once a teenage sci fi geek.  I realize the mention here is something of a non-sequitor, but I found the author's sense of place to be utterly convincing, and am in a reasonably unique position to know.    ""In Some Other World..."" reflects an eclectic heritage, and a sufficiently schlocky press release might make comparisons to ""The Breakfast Club"", ""The Big Chill"", heck, maybe even ""Galaxy Quest"".  Anyway, the apparent cinematic influences are enough to keep things interesting, so while I was a bit disappointed this time, I'd gladly give this author's work another spin."

It began somewhat depressing, a woman feeling trapped in the routine and exhaustion of her married life with kids. Haven't we all felt somewhat downtrodden when our kids are young and we lose our way in cleaning up, feeding, and answering questions?<br /><br />But then it backtracks to her life in the Australian bush and as she begins to grow and blossom into puberty and feeling the power of her own sexuality she reaches out to others to test the power of her new found growth. Naivety puts her in some awkward situations (and as a parent, I found them rather scary) but she is also longing for the returned love of a man as her father has seemingly removed himself from showing signs of love and affection.<br /><br />And then she discovered an old house, seemingly abandoned, that becomes the setting for the biggest change in her life. A time of exploration, blossoming, lessons, love, reflection, growth, turmoil, soul searching and also what often holds her back from living the rest of her life with freedom and abandon.<br /><br />The fact that this is mostly about the relationship (and sexual growth and experimentation) between a young man and a teenage girl is certainly controversial but I don't think it was written to be a political stand on sex with a minor. We never really know her age but since she still has to go back to school at the end of her summer I assumed she was 16 or 17.<br /><br />The writing style is very different than a traditional chapter by chapter story unfolding since we always hear from the first person is snippets of short chapters with very little fill in.<br /><br />What was amazing was how wellit conveys the struggle a woman can go through with sexuality, the power behind it, and the deep emotional feelings that accompany that aspect of a woman. I was really pleased with where the story ended. Just right.<br /><br />It may not be a book for everyone but the writing and intensity of the relationship was beautiful - and heartbreaking."

And as such, I also continue to follow their independent books like this one as well, though I must admit that I never enjoy these solo works as much as the books that they work on together - they always seem to lack something...<br /><br />In Child’s latest enigmalogist hero, Dr. Jeremy Logan, who has appeared in some of Child’s earlier books, though there isn’t really enough of an overlap to necessitate reading these in order, first addresses a crowd guaranteeing there isn’t a Nessie after all. And moments later, the book makes me wish that it had opened a few weeks earlier when Logan reveals that there is a Loch Ness monster after all... Instead, Logan returns to his roots to investigate the odd suicide of a researched at a private institute called the Lux that Logan himself had been asked to leave years earlier.<br /><br />With short chapters and methodical clues, this is a fast read that is also entertaining. Cliffhangers keep the pages turning, though it does take some time for the reader to feel like much genuine progress has been made. And surprisingly, this is a more straightforward thriller than some of Logan’s earlier appearances. And there isn’t any off-the-rails stuff either, which keeps this even more exciting and fast-paced as the plot picks up. Child nicely maintains the tension throughout which makes this one of the strongest yet of Child’s solo novels!"

While the basics remain the same, the story has layers that are peeled off as the story continues to unfold until we at last learn the shocking truth.<br /><br />After the last episode ended with an argument between the Doctor and Leela, this story quickly diffuses the situation in a way that felt a little bit too easy. Still, as Leela says, the Doctor had gone days without talking to her which had led her to read more and what she'd read were fairy tales. Leela's pointing out similaritites to Fairy Tale moments. This device works very well throughout the story, creating a little bit of a sense of rythym, being used for occasional comic relief, and in one case actually adding to the terror of the moment (when Leela's reminded of Little Red Riding Hood meeting the wolf disguised as her grandma.<br /><br />It's a wonderfully atmospheric and clever tale featuring great acting and a superb soundscape."

It is a time and place unfamiliar to most of us and rarely a fictional setting.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the writing just isn't up to the task. To call the plot meandering in an understatement. Too many characters are introduced. The characters are cardboard cut outs. The good guys are really good: loyal, virtuous, high minded. The bad guys are unalloyed bad. Smith initially creates a potentially interesting villain, the Earl of Cumbrae (think Harry Mudd from Star Trek), and a multi-dimensional character, the Dutch Colonel Cornelius Schreuder then proceeds to throw them away. Unfortunate, as both were more interesting than Courtney or any of his friends. The existence of an widespread naval order of chivalry is simply out of place at the time. And there are many small details simply wrong. For instance, one pound of black powder will propel about four pounds of lead shot. A musket ball of that era weighed in at a shade over an ounce so the single pound of powder would be good for about 64 rounds. The panic of Courtney's band of refugees when they find themselves reduced to about 50-lbs of powder is inexplicable.<br /><br />Too much time is spent on events that lead nowhere and the last part of the novel, the climax, is rushed through making it an afterthought that you just want to get through rather than the reason you read the novel."
12166,12167,__label2__,5,N,Books,B0006BTYPA,The Snouters: Form and Life of the Rhinogrades,A marvelous spoof,"This is a marvelous spoof book, written in very formal prose, about totally imaginary creatures. (I found a very nice copy at a garage sale selling for a dollar, 50 cents after a bit of bargaining).<br /><br />This was reprinted by The University of Chicago Press with the following legend: &#34;The Snouters was originally published in Germany, under the title Bau und Leben der Rhinogradentia, by Gustav Fischer Verlag Stuttgart in 1957. Copyright � 1964 by Gustav Fischer Verlag Stuttgart. Portions of the book appeared in Natural History magazine in April 1967 and is reprinted here with permission. The 15 plates and 12 text figures in this volume were drawn by Gerolf Steiner. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago 60637 The University of Chicago Press, Ltd., London.<br /><br />Maggie Koerth-Baker recently wrote a blog post about the book; the picture she refers to can be found by googling Maggie Koerth-Baker imaginary animals.<br /><br />&#34;In this dusty display box at the University of Maine sits the carefully preserved skeleton of a small, shrew-like rodent which, lacking hind legs, propelled itself along with the help of a long, jointed nose-foot. If that seems a bit too whimsical to be true, well, it is. The creature belongs to the mammalian order Rhinogradentia – an entirely made-up class of animals. Like this specimen, which belongs to UMaine professor Irving Kornfield, the rhinogrades are all rodents and they all have some sort of fantastic nasal appendage ... and, most importantly, none of them actually exist.<br /><br />&#34;Now, there are plenty of imaginary animals in the world and, some of them – like the jackalope, for instance – exist in taxidermy and skeletal form despite not existing as living beings. But most of those are folk-crafts, their origins steeped in tall tales or intentionally profitable efforts to mislead, and their inventors lost to time. Rhinogradentia, on the other hand, is relatively new. It was created in 1961 by a real German zoologist named Gerolf Steiner who wanted to illustrate the way evolution can create diversity in isolated populations. In order to do that, Steiner created a fake German zoologist called Harald Stümpke, a fake island chain called Hy-yi-yi, and a fake order of mammals with funny noses. And then he wrote a book about it.<br /><br />&#34; Published under Stümpke's name, The Snouters: Form and Life of the Rhinogrades, is meant to read like a totally serious zoology handbook of the time period. It's a parody that absolutely refuses to wink at you, and it's become a bit of an in-joke among biologists. This particular specimen was actually built by Kornfield, himself, using real animal bones and illustrations from Stümpke/Steiner's book.&#34;<br /><br />I enjoyed reading the book, and enjoyed reading both Maggie Koerth-Baker's description and the marvelous Reviews here on Amazon even more. My only problem is how to dispose of the book, now that I am down sizing my life.<br /><br />Robert C. Ross<br />March 2015"
12204,12205,__label2__,3,N,Books,802408796,Before Burnout: Balanced Living for Busy People (Christian living),Don't Get Burned by Following Jesus,"The authors in Before Burnout deal with perfectionistic attitudes and behavior.  It is interesting that Minirth and Meier write so much about perfectionism and burnout, when they freely admit that they themselves are perfectionists or obsessive-compulsive.  This gives the books a personal touch, however, since they sprinkle personal examples throughout their writings.  They describe two kinds of perfectionists: the quality and the quantity characters.  Like their former volume, How to Beat Burnout, the biblical Martha gets the bad rap.  Unlike the former volume, this one contains no references to sources of information and studies cited.  Though this might make for easier reading, the academic might be frustrated, especially when he or she needs more convincing.  Sometimes it appears that the authors characterize just plain Christian spirituality, truth, and accuracy as obsessive-compulsive (OC) (p. 29).  Even Moses gets labeled an OC (p. 52).  They appear to assume that middle-class values, i.e. people who tend to work long hours, are really OCs (p. 61), and even characterize those with a high need for achievement as OCs (p. 68).  Their psychologizing of Calvin's theology (p. 71) reminds me of Erik Erikson's description of Lutheran theology as ""anal repulsive.""  (Luther was sitting on the pot when the doctrine of justification by faith broke through upon him.)  As in the preceding book, idealism, unrealistic expectations, bitterness and forgiveness are primary themes for recovery.  Yet some of their recommendations appear awkward.  They want their clients to choose friendships that will benefit themselves (p. 134), somewhat reversing Christ's command to love our enemies.  And the later chapters of their book appears only loosely tied to OC or perfectionistic behavior."

We have been on the move since the expulsion from Eden. Hospitality is important and my redesigned living room will enable this. She felt that her years as a teacher prepared her for this.<br /><br />For most of us, loose ends are frightening reminders of our own powerlessness. To name, to label, to classify gives us the illusion of control, even if the closure reached is a false one.<br /><br />In all events, it is important to leave the directee free to accept or reject our insights. Whether we are right, wrong or premature, it is reassuring to remember that we cannot do too much harm since people rarely hear what they are not ready to hear. At the very least, we have possibly planted a seed. As director-midwives, then, we must be willing to wait for the seed to sprout -- if it is supposed to sprout -- and grow to maturity, perhaps long after our relationship with the directee has ceased.<br /><br />If you feel bored by a conversation, the person might be depressed.<br /><br />Like children, directees are on loan.<br /><br />Books should be prescribed cautiously because directee might feel guilty if not appropriate.<br /><br />To clarify: `Tell me more.' `I don't quite understand.'<br /><br />The spiritual director as teacher does not make the connections, although she may make observations, give hints (but without being manipulative), and ask the right questions. Her supportive presence sets the directee free to make the connections; and inner and outer work turn out to be all of a piece.<br />We may spare the very fragile, those who have already more reality than they can bear and are not yet ready to hear the truth. It is sometimes hard to sit with an insight, yet we may say nothing, or we may measure out manageable bits of truth. But with the strong and spirituallymature we need not be so cautious.<br /><br />Can tell one's own story if invited or intuit.<br /><br />The purpose of education is to show a person how to define himself authentically and spontaneously in relation to his world -- not to impose a prefabricated definition of the world, still less an arbitrary definition of the individual himself (Thomas Merton, Love and Living, p. 3)"

His credibility should be reflected in his writing and as I assume are his experiences and expertise.  However, I read that his book must past the Chinese censors and I make the leap that China's censors may be &#34;stricter&#34; than in the U.S.  I didn't consider that when I obtained the book.

It is very well written, and covers the whole breadth of her amazing life.  It is very fair: it doesn't whitewash Day's crankiness or stubbornness or (to an outsider) her willful adherence to a Church that bears no relationship to anything Jesus would have had any part of, on any reasonable reckoning. The community of spirits and the communion of souls are more present in the Catholic Worker's activities in the soup kitchens than in all the popery and bishoprics.  Still, if it was good enough for St. Francis, then it seems to have been good enough for Dorothy Day.  Whether it is worthy of them is a deeper question.<br /><br />Whole sections of the book resonate with the dire situation of the American poor today in the New Depression; and also remind us of the vast political struggle that went on then to wrestle even some kind of mercy from the capitalist machine.  It reminds us of how much people suffered to bring about the basic safety net that ideologues are working day and night to dismantle in favour of the mercilessness of the harsh Gods of the Blessed Free Market.  And how much of that suffering is now, and will likely have to be suffered all over again.<br /><br />The book also reminds us of the stultifying world in which Day operated, and the dreariness of much of it: the drab buildings, the endless dishwashing and sweeping, the narrow mindedness.  It also reminds us of how early Day and her colleagues were in so many protests: anti-nuclearism, race and Vietnam being only a few of them.  It would be a good book to give to contemporary activitists:  perhaps the strongest message in the book is the need for order and discipline throughout both the dreariness and the wildness; and the essential role of daily prayer (of whatever kind) to keep one going in the midst of the burdens of chaos and failure on many levels."

One of my best friends from Westfield High School was a big fan of his growing up - had his success pyramid on his bedroom wall, etc.<br /><br />Since I played football, track and baseball, I was mainly interested in his teams always wining the NCAA men's Basketball championship, seemingly every year.

13909,13910,__label2__,3,N,Books,006103116X,The Rock Says...,Dwayne Johnson - The Rock Says,"The Rock Says...: The Most Electrifying Man in Sports-Entertainment.<br /><br />By Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson with Joe Layden.<br /><br />Published by HarperEntertainment.<br /><br />Released January 5, 2000.<br /><br />Pages 304, hard back.<br /><br />No introduction is necessary for Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, he is possibly the most recognised wrestler of all time, a successful movie star, one of the top merchandise sellers of all time inside the wrestling industry and one of the most charismatic superstars ever. Gaining world heavyweight championship gold a total of 9 times in a relatively short full time career of 8 years. The Rock is unquestionably a future inductee into the WWE Hall of Fame.<br /><br />But does The Rock Says... have the same credentials as the man telling his story? As you would expect there is a lot of humour through-out the retelling of The Rock's story. The first six chapters of the book cover his early life, football career and training for his future in Sports-Entertainment complete with amusing anecdotes mirrored by the mischief he got himself caught up in as a teenager. The following nine chapters are devoted to his in ring career, recounting his metamorphosis from Rocky Maivia into The Rock, taking you to the time so you can understand why the audience were the deciding factor in Dwayne going from a sparkling clean good guy to the third person speaking, cocky villain known as the 'People's Champion'. Rock recalls backstage shenanigans as he tells his story, most notably with Mick Foley, Rocky also covers key matches and points in his career telling the matches as if he is in the match, speaking in character, in third person. The Rock Says... follows the Most Electrifying Man in Sports-Entertainment all the way up until Wrestlemania 15 against his arch nemesis 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin. There is an additional emotional chapter added before it was published dedicated to remembering the life of Owen Hart who tragically died during the period of time the book was written in.<br /><br />The main flaw with this autobiography of The Rock is it was written too soon, at publication in 2000 it was at the height of his career, being only half way through his full time portion. Even though he tells the matches as if they were legitimate rather than as they actually are, he does discuss certain behind the scenes aspects, however do not expect a tell all, expose the business type read. Overall The Rock Says... is an entertaining read if you are a fan of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and want to know about his life before wrestling mixed with funny stories from his career up until Wrestlemania 15.<br /><br />3/5 Stars<br /><br />By Jimmy Wheeler"

13965,13966,__label2__,5,N,Books,1502436736,The 3rd American Dream: That is Global in Reach,"Inspiring, informative, practical. An essential for anybody with ambition.","As I read through Sharma's &#34;The 3rd American Dream,&#34; I found myself nodding at every page. His book - perhaps more aptly described as a treatise - is a masterful analysis of the past, present, and future of the elusive ideal we have come to know as &#34;The American Dream.&#34; His core message to ambitious Americans is clear: times are changing, and if we wish to seize the American Dream, we must all be prepared for it.<br /><br />Sharma himself mentions that the book - while age-independent - is tailored for younger generations. As a college student myself, I found his text to be surprisingly refreshing and accessible, considering the heavy topics it discusses. This was a welcome change of pace, since I was so accustomed to stale academic textbooks that spent far too much time discussing abstract theories, rather than synthesizing coherent lessons and offering practical advice.<br /><br />Indeed, &#34;The 3rd American Dream&#34; is a practical text. In Sharma's own words: &#34;You must have a vision - but remember - one lives by the day.&#34; It reads like a narrative while maintaining a solid focus on weaving together important topics to dispense valuable advice for entrepreneurs, students, investors - indeed all Americans with a goal in mind and the heart to pursue it.<br /><br />As a young American, I see the truth of Sharma's words DAILY resonating throughout our society. He discusses the unique, innovative atmosphere of the American people, the paradigm-shifting importance of the woman-operated enterprise as a vehicle for gender equality, the necessity for an infrastructure that facilitates the growth and development of future Americans, the various global superpowers (India, China, the USA, etc) and the industries they dominate, the various emerging trends in business...and so much more. And he never sacrifices depth for breadth; like a skilled diver, he plunges into each topic and surfaces with a new pearl of practical wisdom, backed by research andpersonal experience.<br /><br />This text is an essential read for any reader who understands the thrilling pursuit of the American dream. It equips readers with the historical knowledge they need to understand their place in history, the practical business knowledge they need to navigate the market place, and the motivational message that, if we take charge of our lives and make conscious, predictive decisions, we can realize the 3rd American Dream, turning the United States into - in Sharma's own words - &#34;the path to infinite prosperity.&#34;<br />Inspiring. A must-read. I highly recommend it."

She's facing trouble from a bullying jock who has an unexpected ally from Grimworld.  Fortunately, Lisara does have Ryosuke, who might be a horny geek, but he also possesses a great sense of gallantry.  Thanks to a mystic sword Lisara put in him soon after they met, she can tap his sex drive for energy, and Ryosuke finds just how much he can empower her, but the sword has some other side effects that make Ryosuke a bit less likeable, especially at the end, which makes me both curious and nervous about the direction this series will go.

I didn't learn anything new, but enjoyed it nevertheless.  If you are familiar with Steele's work, you won't get anything new from it.  But, if you are new to Steele's work, then this is an impressive, thought-provoking read.  In my opinion, his research is necessary in understanding how stereotypes impact us in ways that most people may not realize..and, how people may be conveying stereotype without even realizing it (or intending to)."

For Ellington the orchestra was his instrument and this book is as complex as its many members and relationships. None more so that his exploited, brilliant altar ego the composer and arranger Billy Strayhorn. Teachout reveals that typically Ellington failed to credit his collaborators and kept the royalties for his music to fund the expense of keeping the well paid band on the road.

German soldiers are living in the village and most of the French residents are not happy with the occupation.  Céleste’s brother is a member of the French resistance. Céleste wants to join the cause, however, her brother won’t let her in an effort to keep her safe. However, when her brother is arrested, she feels that she has to join the resistance to help him escape.<br /><br />You would think this is enough stress for one character to endure. You’d be wrong. Not only is  Céleste a member of the resistance, she’s also a young woman in love. With a German officer. Yep, you read that right. While she’s fighting against the Germans, she is also in a secret relationship with one. That’s not all for the twists and turns, but I don’t want to ruin the novel.<br /><br />I have to admit that I wasn’t too familiar with this part of the war before reading this. I had heard that the German occupation of France was peaceful for the most part. This novel shows how devastating the occupation was to the individuals and families who had to endure it. I found myself cheering on  Céleste and her compatriots.<br /><br />The plot kept me engaged and I found myself rushing through to the end to find out what would happen. Every time I thought poor  Céleste wouldn’t be able to handle any more, there was yet another hurdle for her to overcome. She didn’t always make the right choice, but she was brave throughout. I admired her determination, overlooked her impetuosity (she’s only 19 at the start of the story), and wanted her to succeed even though the odds were against her. You’ll have to read for yourself to find out if she did. This story shows the true brutality of war, even on the “peaceful” fronts, and it highlights how brave people can be during such a horrific time in history."

15978,15979,__label2__,5,N,Books,1439198950,To the Last Breath: A Memoir of Going to Extremes,Inspirational,"One man's journey to conquer the physical becomes his emotional deliverance. Francis Slakey begins his quest with a goal in mind - set a record, to be the first man to climb the highest mountain on every continent and to surf every ocean. The challenge he sets out in front of him seems simple at the time: 8 peaks, 4 shorelines, 12 experiences to check off his To Do List. He is driven by his indifference to the world to shrug it off in this independent series of adventures. The world, as it turns out, would have none of that.<br /><br />Slakey is brutally honest about his own agenda, and about how he failed others in following it. At first he failed others, that is. But as he slowly began to open himself up to the amazing experiences surrounding him at every turn, his agenda changed. He changed. He found that it was possible to evolve from someone serving himself to someone serving others. And he didn't do it with a mushy gushy love story, although love was present. He did it by finding that man within himself, the one that always existed. Just as he encourages us to do, simply by telling his story.<br /><br />Inspirational and exciting, follow Francis Slakey as he scales mountains, crosses plains of ice, hunkers down during blizzards, and dodges bullets in an around-the-world adventure that is like none the average joe will ever have. Slakey shares with us his most amazing experiences and his darkest moments and through it all we discover a man we can all learn from. Read it for the adventure, sure, but take away from it the perspective.<br /><br />I received this book for free through the Goodreads First Reads program."

I was aware of this, and also that he was given endless latitude in selecting his topics.  This is the first (and definitely last) book of his that I have read, discovering it at my local library branch sitting on a table.  With a quote from TLS and a reminder that he has a Pulitzer for criticism, it sounded like a promising read.<br /><br />Boy did I loath this book!  I awarded it 2 stars simply because I reserve 1 star for books that are horribly written, which this isn't.  There is nothing technically wrong with the writing.  The author can write a sentence and string several together in a paragraph.  No, I hated this book for the creepy tone and the all-knowing blather.  Call this a self-help book for the intellectually insecure.<br /><br />The assumption behind this book seems to be that there are hordes of people eager to read but utterly clueless about what they should read.  Yes, should read, not want to read.  This is reading as something between castor oil and self-improvement, and reeks of the same white male well-educated superiority that was so popular in the 1950s.  If you liked Adler's Great Books, this is the book for you!  But even Adler limited his all-knowingness to the intellectual realm, instructing the rest of us what we should read.  Not Dirda!  Nope, in addition to endless lists of books we Should Read, he has advice on seemingly all other aspects of life.  ""When we consider the ways we might spend our leisure hours...we shouldn't overlook or neglect hobbies and pets.""  ""Though books can obviously help create a holiday spirit, do not neglect traditional activities.  Listen to Christmas songs on the radio.  Go caroling...""<br /><br />There are over a hundred ""literary"" quotes that the author has lovingly saved up over a lifetime just waiting, apparently, for an opportunity to foist them upon his starved for education readers.

16480,16481,__label2__,5,N,Books,881462713,A Death at the White Camellia Orphanage,"Notes while reading ""A Death at the White Camellia Orphanage""","I've finally had a chance to read the first couple chapters of Marly Youmans' Death at the White Camellia Orphanage. People will inevitably call it Faulknerian - it's Deep South, it's hot, it's told through the lens of a boy who's neurologically atypical. And it's got fruit and blood. But if you have any spiritual antennae at all, you'll quickly grasp that it's anti-Faulkner. There's fullness, not emptiness, in back of everything.<br /><br />And the story is backwards, too. Christianity first made its way by claiming the crucifixion and resurrection as the answer to evil. But this novel turns that upside down: in this the novel the crucifixion (at least) is the evil that must be answered. Pip knows at once, in his chaotic, inarticulate way, that everyone is responsible for the death of his brother. The question is, how do you find your way, hobbled with knowing that? Christianity here is the question, not the answer.<br /><br />-------<br /><br />'""Light,"" he whispered. He would collect, slowly and laboriously, a sufficient radiance.'<br /><br />So Pip's story goes on, to the scary parts: where he goes about collecting light. Of course he does, because that's what human beings do: but Pip's working under such a deficit that he has no real thought for what it's going to do to other people, and to himself eventually, if he simply makes up his own rules and plunders it. Here's where the book turns into a book about me, and I find myself reluctant to pick it back up: at twilight the camellia on the cover hovers like a ghost on the end table.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />It takes a long slow weary time to become human, for some of us. ""I preach the Church of the Bitter End and the news of your guilt, boy."" I'm loving Marly's White Camelia: the story of Pip's slow coming-to-humanity cuts close to the bone, for me. It's always been too easy for me to cut free of ties, to shrug and wonder if any of it matters, really, to lose myself in the sheer welter of the senses, the building of patterns and their collapse.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />I don't often read novels about myself. Oh, sure, all novels are about me: I am Jane Eyre, David Copperfield, and Ishmael - not to mention Rochester and Micawber and Ahab - and so are you; but that's only because we all are. It's only once in decade, maybe, that I meet myself in a novel in a more personal way, so as to turn red and plus myself non: I didn't know anyone knew this about me. Tolstoy wrote a monstrous great novel about me, calling me Pierre Kirillovich Bezukhov; Trollope once gracefully eviscerated me under the name of Bertie Stanhope. But no one had written about my childhood and coming-of-age, which was a grimmer story than either Tolstoy or Trollope had in mind. Suppose you are a boy of ferocious will and intense desire. Suppose there is an early overwhelming loss, a hole where the center of your life should be. Suppose what is difficult for other people is easy for you, while what's easy for them is impossible: you can solve quadratic equations in your head, but you can't remember the names of the other kids in your classroom. Suppose the sensual world is overwhelming, full of beauties and patterns, while the social world is full of puzzling, trivial detail. Suppose you are awkward, clumsy, irritating: and yet, when whispering time comes, possessed of an eldritch capacity for persuasion. Suppose your own vulnerabilities are so different from other people's that you regularly wound, and are wounded, without anybody meaning any harm. How do you grow up? And how do you recover from a deep, precocious understanding of evil, which - for all your immaturity - marks you as old?<br /><br />Well, by blundering about, and doing a fair amount of damage; by lots of dumb luck, and by the grace of strangers who are extraordinarily generous and kind. That's my story, and it's Pip Tatnall's too. I cared enough about the outcome of this novel that when I was twenty pages from the end I suddenly stopped, and put off finishing it for several days. I was afraid it would end badly, and I couldn't have stood that.<br /><br />It doesn't end badly. But 'nuff said."

16584,16585,__label2__,2,N,Books,547746504,The Lower River,Snake bit,"Author Paul Theroux is highly acclaimed and his books have caught my eye on many occasions, especially his travel stories in Asia. When this was available via the Vine Program, I was happy to get a free taste. I'm not sure whether this book is indicative of his style or not, but if so, I'm unlikely to read any of his other work. Perhaps the many review references to The Heart of Darkness, a novel I'm in the minority in disliking, should've been a clue.<br /><br />The Lower River is a sad, terse, and largely empty tale of an older man wanting to go back to a time in his life he's tenaciously clung to as the greatest period of a life lived through the rear view mirror. It isn't hard to figure out how this will go, and worse yet, Theroux didn't surprise me. I followed depressed old Ellis Hock back to Africa and read as things proceeded exactly as I imagined, like watching a slow motion car crash, or perhaps more appropriately, a slow motion snake bite.<br /><br />The writing was emotionally flat and not nearly as revelatory as I think a story such as this begs to be. Hock has lived his life holding a brief but highly idealized period of his life in a state of suspension, amazingly incapable of envisioning that it would have changed dramatically in forty years. Even with this particular area of Africa being extremely remote, it's hard to imagine someone being so naïve as to think he could return to a place after four decades and pick up where he left off. Sadder still, it would seem that he failed to completely live in the everyday world of his life, preferring instead to mentally wander back to the village he cherished so much. One wonders what he might've made of his life post-Africa had he invested a fraction of the enthusiasm into said life that he's held exclusively for Malawi.<br /><br />I understand that Theroux is making larger points about the issue of Africa's poverty and trying to paint a very different picture than the one the charity folks would like us tosee.  To that end the author describes quite well Hock's creeping dread and the crushing despair that breeds resignation for some, malevolence in others. Beyond this, the characters were limited in depth, descriptions were often repetitive, and there was a sense of not knowing where to go with the story. Had Theroux fashioned this into a sad short story reflection on the folly of living in the past, I'd have liked it more because the second half seemed like a deliberate addition to try and add some suspense. To that end, it didn't work. The Lower River was a disappointment because it was neither entertaining nor engaging for me.  2.5 stars."

Dyer found out where and when Great Uncle Clayton disappeared and reappeared but answers to the mystery of Clayton's behavior are most likely contained within the rapid rise and fall of the L. R.

16758,16759,__label2__,5,Y,Books,870219618,The Sea Power of the State,Admiral Gorshkov: Russia's Mahan and Rickover?,"Sea Power of the State, written by Admiral of the Fleet Sergei G. Gorshkov and published in 1976 during his tenure as the Soviet Navy's Commander-in-Chief, provides a rarely available view into the strategic thinking which guided the development and disposition of Russian Naval forces during the 1960's and 1970's; the first time Russia possessed naval forces capable of conducting sustained operations on the world's oceans--albeit a fleet relying primarily on submarines. A considerable achievement given that when Gorshkov assumed command of the Russian Navy in 1956 it consisted primarily of vessels designed for coastal defense and was incapable of logistically supporting the ocean operation of its few capital ships or its large submarine force.  A former Naval Officer who was assigned during the aforementioned period to ships participating in an ASW (Anti-Submarine Warfare) Group which on occasion practiced the art of ASW by chasing Soviet submarines across the Pacific Ocean, as well as having personally participated as an Officer of the Deck (OOD) in sea going Soviet Navy precipitated surface confrontations, I found Gorshkov's writings interesting and most informative. ""Sea Power of the State,"" however, is not an easy read, perhaps due to translation difficulties when proceeding from Russian into English or due to the style in which Gorshkov communicated his thoughts. Further, individual points are to frequently repeated, almost to the point of nuisance. And, of course, the book is replete with ""socialist"" anti-western verbiage about the evil motivations of the aggressive imperialist nations--especially the United States. Given the Soviet Union's de facto record of Eastern Europe colonization, a reader can only wonder whether Gorskov's expressed political views actually reflect the thinking of the Soviet High Command or were just pro forma boilerplate.  ""Sea Power of the State"" is divided into several parts and opens with a 25+ page dissertation on the economic significance of ocean floor minerals, etc. giving the impression this geological survey will play a key factor underlying Gorshkov's strategic views, however, the subject area essentially (not totally) disappears from the book thereafter. It is followed by a similarly treated 30 page discussion of the importance of fishing and merchant shipping to the sea power of a state.  The next two chapters contain a 100+ page view of ""The History of [Selected] Navies"" and a 50+ page treatise on the author's views of the ""The Development of Navies after the Second World War."" These reviews and their encompassed assessments seem to provide the historical analysis on which Gorshkov based the strategic goals and objecitves he envisioned the Soviet Navy pursuing and the force formations he would configure to affect those goals.  When reviewing the American and British oceanic conflict with opposing German and Japanese fleets, Gorshkov's concentration repeatedly focuses how (he viewed) submarine warfare's influence on the war's outcome, leading him to conclude:  ""Submarines become the most important means of battle at sea. And if individual states in the pre-war period underestimated their possibilities, in the course of the war they changed their views on the use of submarine forces. .... Earlier the view was repeatedly expressed that submarines are a weapon of the weakest fleet and that strong fleets have no need of them. However, this view was flatly rebutted by the experience of the war [when] submarines of the strongest American fleet performed [the] most important role ... not only ... against Japanese shipping, but also against surface ships and submarines.""  Gorshkov, however, fails to correctly comprehend the strategically decisive role played by Aircraft Carriers and their Air Groups during World War II in the Pacific. He absurdly attributes the Japanese post-Battle of Midway retreat onto the defensive as having occurred due to the Soviet Army's victory at Stalingrad. To Gorshkov the Aircraft Carrier centric surface battles of the Pacific War could have no strategic effect because the force levels involved were so much less then were engaged in the manpower intensive (slaughters) on the Soviet / German Eastern front, perhaps demonstrating a flaw in the strategic thinking of Russian Admirals resulting from their nation's geographically necessitated concentration on large scale ground warfare. Other historical events such as the participation of Russian sailors in their country's 20th Century Civil War and the Soviet Navy's (exaggerated) contributions to the outcome of World War II are discussed in these page, but this commentary adds little to the understanding of the strategic goals Gorshkov envisioned the Soviet Navy pursuing in the post-World War II environment.  Building on this historical analysis Gorshkov concludes that ""problems associated with the art of naval warfare"" render dominance of the sea an unobtainable strategic result--as versus its possible achievement on land surfaces. His analysis underlying this conclusion is to lengthy to repeat here, but it rests on several observations and assumptions. First, Gorshkov believes that the fluid non-fixed nature of the sea precludes a naval force from firmly establishing itself in a fixed location enforcing that dominance and, second, that modern weapons systems enable fleets to extend the distance over which they could apply their [explosive] force thereby contesting any attempt at fixed dominance of a given sea area.   Clearly Russian strategic thinking did not encompass the need to establish forward bases such as those the U.S. Navy maintains around the world, probably due to the Russian military's demonstrated inability to manage substantial logistics flow over a long distance, precluding their establishing and maintaining distant bases. I personally know a number of intelligent former Russian soldiers who served in Afghanistan and asked them why the combat force the Soviet Army sent into that country was so numerically low. Their response was that their military simply lacked the logistic capabilities to sustain a force greater than 120,000 men that far from home. An acknowledgement that their nation simply lacked the management skills to logistically support a large force such as a Naval Task Group far from home, which Gorshkov must have realized.  However, despite their logistics management shortcomings, the Soviet Union did possess sufficient bright individuals with technical engineering skills and the industrial structure needed to design, produce, and staff a large number of nuclear powered submarines carrying modern weapons systems, communications capabilities, etc. needed for their Navy to maintain a large number of these vessels at sea. A technical and industrial base which Admiral Gorshkov notes necessarily underlies the development of modern navies and without which a nation cannot successfully aspire to be a sea power. Gorshkov's answer, therefore, to his problems was the deployment of a large number of nuclear powered submarines which could steam almost indefinitely at sea, restricted only by their crews need for food. A force that could target the sea communications the ""imperialist"" western industrial nations needed to support their worldwide ""aggressive"" interventions, at least in the socialist speak of the Soviet high command.  ""Sea Power of the State"" is a fascinating look into the mind of the high command of one of this nation's major military opponents. It is a rare treat and makes for a fascinating read, at least for officers of the opposing services and for anyone interested in how high level military officers view problems--especially a military officer as prominent and influential as was Admiral Gorshkov."

I generally skim or skip when the action gets too hot and heavy. (If I want erotica, I know where to find it.) I read Showalter because she manages somehow to go really super dark in her plots - hyper-violence! epic battles of good vs. evil! superbeings clashing over world-shattering stakes! - while still being really whimsical. Sometimes maybe a little on the verge of too much, maybe. The women in this book sounded to me like a Cosmo quorum. But it's still playful and breezy and good-spirited and leavens the darkness nicely. Fantasy-horror-rom-com.<br /><br />Sometimes I have a problem with Showalter's world building. She's been at it so long and has built such an amazing canon that I'm constantly stumbling over plots and people I don't remember or just don't know, and I've run into a book or two where I felt sidelined by subplots or set-up for a future book. That wasn't an issue at all in Burning Dawn. There were references to the broader mythos and, yes, some groundwork, but it never distracted from the main story or left me confused.<br /><br />Anyhoodle, if you pant over alpha men and flippant women with a heart of gold, if your stomach doesn't churn when people are disemboweled or beheaded in fiction (or if you can push past it), if you can handle a story that is simultaneously grim and bouncy, AND if you do not shy at some pretty explicit shenanigans between (and above and nowhere near) the sheets, this could be the book for you.<br /><br />Fun times. I recommend."

The bad news is if you want to read a book that will scare the actual sleep from you, you're best off reading Neil Gaiman's ""The Ocean at the End of the Lane.""<br /><br />""Doctor Sleep"" is not a bad book.  It's actually one of King's better books, but ranks below his most recent works ""Joyland"" and ""11/22/63.""<br /><br />The books fails in an area that you would not expect from King.  It's not long enough.  The most interesting part of the book is the beginning.  The scariest part of the book is the beginning.  Danny's early days following what happened at the Overlook are far more interesting than anything else and the least developed.  How does one survive something as horrifying as what happened to the young Danny?<br /><br />It was King himself, I believe, who once said that a book is only as good as its villain.  And while the concept of psychic vampires is interesting, the characters themselves are rather weak and hamstrung quite easily.<br /><br />How was the True Knot formed?  Who are these people?  Who was Rose?  How did she come to be?  Where is her origin story?  We are treated in the beginning to the origin story of one the members and then that character is barely seen for the rest of the book.<br /><br />Again, this was not a bad book.  If it were not by King, I might have rated it higher, but I've come to expect more from him.  In the end he didn't let down Danny completely, but he could have done better by him."

17402,17403,__label2__,5,N,Books,615499848,The Science of the Quran: Proving God's Existence through Established Modern Science,Thought provoking book,"To be clear, The Science of the Quran is not just a book about science as it is found within the Quran but also presents a background on science and on Islam. Because of this, even readers who have no previous familiarity with this religion or with science will have no trouble following this book. One reason for this is the three-part formatting through which information is presented. The author starts by going over the Quran and some of its main themes, the life of the last prophet, and a bit of Islam's history in part one while including some of the prophet's sayings on a variety of topics. Then the author goes on to cover the nature of science and some science history while presenting some principles upon which he believes make up the structure of science.  I found this middle section of the book (part 2) to be somewhat unnecessary considering that part 3 of the book covers the science as it relates to the Quran with the verse translations and interpretations in the same small section. Also, some sections of this part were very general and self-explanatory to the point where leaving them out wouldn't have taken from the book. However, if you do not have a background in science or don't remember much from your science/history classes then you may like this section because it is a nice brief review.<br /><br />The significance of this book is in part 3 where the author goes over different fields of science and how the Quran contains some of the relatively recent discoveries despite being written over 1400 years ago. For me, this section was eye opening and the author's translation of the Quranic verses shed a new light on their meaning. I speak both arabic and english and the author successfully showed how slight nuances in translation can result in a whole new meaning to verses. Whether you are a muslim or not, scientist or not, everyone has something to learn from this book. You may not reach the same conclusions as the author because they are based on his interpretation of ayaat but you will think about Islam from a new perspective."

It recalled to mind [[ASIN:0394742575 Sex and Death to the Age 14]], not for stylistic reasons, but because the focus of these stories is relentlessly those of a teen. Disease, arousal, death, smatterings of religiosity, more arousal, more death, more disease. Then too, there is the clear influence of an MFA program interlaced throughout.

17696,17697,__label2__,5,Y,Books,1433530872,"ESV Single Column Legacy Bible (TruTone, Brown/Saddle, Timeless Design)",ESV Single Column Legacy Bible,"ESV Single Column Legacy Bible - 9781433530876 - Trutone Brown/Cordovan  I just received this Bible today, and I'm very impressed. It's strictly a black-letter, paragraphed text Bible: no references (or rather, only a very few), no study notes, no introductions. The page layout is very much like a ""normal"" book, i.e., single column instead of the usual two columns of text. The only place where the publisher has continued the typical practice of Bible layout is by including chapter and verse numbers within the text itself. I'd have preferred to see these numbers consigned to a margin (like the original edition of the New Jerusalem Bible), but I really don't mind the verse numbers. Unlike some ESV Bibles, the verse numbers are not in bold, so they don't stick out so much.  A wonderful feature of the page layout is that subject headings are not allowed to break the flow of text. They are printed on the page but appear in the margin beside the text, so you can ignore them if you want.  Another reviewer complained that the font is too small. I disagree. I think this font is quite readable -- it's not large, but it's certainly larger than the font in most Bibles. To me it seems just right.  The Bible overall is bigger and heavier than I expected -- and I would honestly have preferred it to be smaller. This Bible is not something you will be able to easily toss in a backpack or briefcase. But the size feels ""right."" In other words, it's inviting. I find that I keep wanting to pick it up, open it and start reading.  Two other minor problems for me: in my opinion the white space on each page is excessive, especially in the area beneath the text. The bottom margin is fully 1 1/4 inches, but the top margin seems to be just under 3/4 of an inch. It's surely odd that the top and bottom margins are not equal.  Also, I find the spine is rather stiff. Since the inner margin on each page is pretty small, I have to carefully, but with some difficulty, bend open the gutter to make thepages lie flat enough to read without difficulty. (This is a strong contrast to the ESV compact Bible I also have -- the pages open flat very easily in that Bible.) I expect this will get to be less of a problem over time.  Yet all these criticisms are picayune. This is a beautiful Bible. I would go so far as to say I've been waiting for a Bible as attractive and inviting as this one for years. It has class. It has beauty. Sitting on my desk, it simply *wants* to be read.  Another improvement in this Bible over previous ESV editions is that the publishers have dropped the very short, and to me simply worthless, introductions that they've put into many of their other text Bibles, such as the compact Bibles. The latter is small enough to fit into a pocket, but the publisher crams the silly one-paragraph introductions into it. But they're gone from the Legacy Bibles.  On the other hand, there's still a short (75-page) concordance and eight pages of maps in the back. Not really desirable for me, but okay, no problem. Maybe if I ever need to find a verse reference with a common word in it and don't have access to google, I'll use the concordance. But today I tested it with the first word that came to mind -- ""Amminadab"" -- and it's not in this concordance. Oh well.  And this is a great translation. I'm not someone who gets into the ""translation wars."" I like lots of translations -- NRSV, New Jerusalem, New Living, as well as oddball versions like those of Richmond Lattimore, Reynolds Price, Everett Fox, Robert Alter, etc.; they're all great to me. And of course even hoary old King James is not to be sneered at. But more and more I find myself using as a ""basic"" translation the ESV: it's traditional, it's accurate, its tone is about as ""high"" as you're going to get in a modern version, and it's literal enough that many literary elements of the original languages come through. Maybe it can't always be instantly comprehended by a sixth-grader, but so what? That's what commentaries and other versions are for.  In conclusion, I love this Bible, and I think anyone who wants a Bible for actual *reading* -- not just referencing or giving as a gift or carrying around as a fashion accessory -- will love it too. My final score: 9.5 out of 10.  PS Now I'm just waiting for the soon-to-be-released Clarion Reference ESV from Cambridge: who will win the ""reader's Bible"" award -- Crossway or Cambridge? The world waits with eager anticipation ...  EDIT:  I just noticed this Bible is actually larger than the Crossway website claims it is. Crossway says it's 6"" x 9""; in fact it's 6.5"" x 9.5"". That extra half-inch makes a difference: the Bible is bigger and heavier than it needs to be. Since a half-inch could easily be removed from the very wide margins on the pages without affecting the size of the type, it's puzzling the size was increased. But if you like wide margins for note-taking, this will be a plus. On the down side, that extra half-inch means this Bible won't fit into a standard medium size Bible case -- and a standard large size Bible case is a bit too large. Of the Bible cases I've tried, the one that fits best is the large thinline size made by Gregg. (A better option than a Bible case would be a tablet computer sleeve like the [[ASIN:B001Q3MA80 Case Logic VLS-110 Sleeve for 7-Inch to 10-Inch Netbooks and iPad]].) As for weight, keep in mind this Bible is rather heavy at 2 lbs 10 oz.  Also, regarding verse numbering, I just noticed the Legacy ESV does place verse numbers in the margin for poetic texts such as the Psalms, and it works quite well.  Finally, after spending some more time reading from the Legacy ESV, I notice the spine is quickly becoming ""wrinkled"" -- it's very soft and apparently is *so* soft its shape is becoming distorted from holding the Bible open for any length of time. It's not a serious problem, and this is, after all, an imitation leather binding, so I don't expect perfection. But it's too bad all the same. Better quality bindings will perhaps not have this problem."

The book is an incredible inspiration for anyone who has a business as it details the many times that he could have failed and didn't because of his incredible commitment, dedication and vision. He has many of the talents of Gates and Jobs but his wealth accumulation and his impact will likely exceed both. SpaceX earlier this week was just certified by the US Air Force to launch satellites for the Pentagon, wrestling the monopoly away from the United Launch Alliance, a joint space venture formed in 2006 by Lockheed Martin and Boeing Defense. This should allow SpaceX to capture a major portion of the $80 billion annual revenues from space launches.  This is the first of many biographies about Musk that will be written just like was done for Steve Jobs who is really the only person that can be fairly compared to Musk. More than likely Musk's contributions to tech and humanity will far exceed Jobs as they nearly have now and he is 15 years younger than Jobs and will likely far out live him. The book is not an authorized autobiography but ultimately Musk agreed to allow the author dozens of personal hours of time with him in which he was able to reveal many details about his life. Some of the facts I found fascinating is that while everyone knows that he is from South Africa, I have read many articles about Elon but never saw any mention of his American ancestry which goes back many generations. His great grandfather and grandfather were actually American chiropractors both graduating from the Palmer school. His grandfather was quite the explorer and aviator and eventually moved his family to South Africa but wound up dying in an aviation accident.  The book describes Musk as having a photographic memory and reading up to two books a day while he was a child. When he ran out of books he started reading the Encyclopedia Britannica. This is likely one of the characteristics that contributed to his success. But the downside of his brain is that he would frequently reflect on items and he had challenges making friends as a child. This was such an issue that his parents had his adenoids removed  hoping that it would solve the problem.  So while Elon was born in South Africa, America can rightly claim his as hers as most of his innovations were in the US and his ancestral lineage is here.  It is also interesting that his mother was strikingly beautiful and was a finalist for Miss South Africa and continued to be a model into her sixties.  Although the book is not an authorized by Elon, it offers many important early details into his life and will quite likely eventually emerge as one of the most important American entrepreneurs ever born. The writing is easy and even more enjoyable to read the Walter Isaacson's authorized Jobs biography. While I have yet to read the entire book and will update my review once I have, if you are a Tesla or Musk fan than I strongly recommend that you read this deeply inspirational book.  BTW, I personally own two Tesla S sedans. I preordered my first one nearly two years before it was made and got one of the first 2000 made. I liked it so much I gave it to my girlfriend and I purchased the P85 two years later. I will purchase the P85D in the next year or so but will wait till they add more features. Not only has the Tesla rated much higher than any other car Consumer Report ever evaluated but it is the safest car or SUV ever tested.  The P85D has an insane mode that will move the four door sedan from 0 to 60 in 3.2 seconds, but because it has two electric motors and is an all wheel drive car it is faster 0-30 than any commercial car out there, including Ferrari, MclLaren, Lamborghini or Corvettes"

I doubt that even your 'average' teenager, or pre-teen for that matter, would find this 'a good read', so it certainly is not for an adult reader.  It was simply fluff.

Each story made me feel inspired by God's 4 legged friends, and inspired by the human's who benefited from them.  There are lessons in every chapter of this book!  I was able to share this book with my husband, son and daughter (both teens) and everyone enjoyed it and found time to talk about specific dogs and what they did for their owners, it made excellent dinner table conversation!

This book sounded good.  In looking at the table of contents here on Amazon, I liked that it seemed to address the standards, etc.<br /><br />But I am disappointed...<br />1 - Over and over, the 'activities' are repetitive games or cutesy activities rather than actual learning activities.  The only things that seem to change are the props - fake spiders., flies, frogs, etc.  The game idea is repetitive ('short path game', 'long path game', etc. Essentially for too many activities, little changes other than the props and what's on the laminated board.,<br />2 - The directions are vague and non-directive.  This is a critical problem since seasoned teachers should be able to quickly skim to find activities to find salient data - 'close reading' only when material deserves it (i.e., is worth the time). &#34;Descriptions&#34; meander rather than state the important stuff up front.  &#34;Materials&#34; are written as a narrative (vs. concisely)  Critical information (such as failing to include 'go on a field trip' in &#34;Pumpkin Growing Prediction chart&#34; (no seeds or seed growing is included ... how can kids predict growth without actually seeing it?)<br />3 - 'Mathematics Content Standards Connection' - fails to list the SPECIFIC standard being addressed- and the ones listed in the beginning are NOT the ones that Kindergartens across the nation use. (&#34;... This activity aligns to the Data Analysis and Probability Standard because children are organizing data...&#34;) (but they're not, since the &#34;materials&#34; for activity doesn't include this)<br />4 - While this would be something the well equipped classroom (with all the fake animals, etc., needed for activities) could use, most classroom teachers don't have ready access to fake frogs, flies, spiders, dogs, etc.<br />5 - Over and over the authors write (after 'MODIFICATIONS FOR SPECIAL NEEDS OR SITUATIONS') &#34;No special modifications are needed... 'No modifications are anticipated ... This activity is accessible to all children... HA! Then WHY ARE THESE KIDS CONSIDERED 'SPECIAL NEEDS'? The authors have not seriously taken into consideration the needs of kids with all manner of disabilities - to repeatedly say no modifications are needed is to ignore the reality that kids like mine won't learn effectively when given instruction like this.  At the very least, these should have been reviewed by special ed teachers re: accuracy.<br /><br />All in all, I am dearly disappointed in the lack of actual teaching instruction other that cutesy activities.<br /><br />A better mathematics choice? ' Mathematics Their Way'... Its a gem. Has stood the test of time.  Just ordered a used one since my original from 30 years ago is long gone.<br /><br />9"

Nineteen forty-five marked the nadir of human civilization, to quote Gunter Grass who served in a branch of the SS during the dark world war. I suggest that one read Samuel's work after having digested Solzhenitsyn's &#34; Prussian Nights: A Poem (1977)&#34; and M. Hillers's &#34;A Woman in Berlin: Eight Weeks in the Conquered City (2000),&#34; possibly in the reverse order. Samuel says (p. 346) &#34;... the dirt of our lives was not only under our fingernails and our unwashed bodies but had penetrated our souls.&#34; Solzhenitsyn and Hillers in their respective books or rather in their litanies describe in detail when and how human beings turn into inhuman beasts in the midst of the bloody calvary. The only hitch in Samuel's book is that Wolfgang appears to too ably digest the many incomprehensible and complex war situations that even the grown-ups wouldn't be able to comprehend. In part of the story, often times Wolfgang's child's eye view inadvertently gets transformed into a grown-up's eye view."

19387,19388,__label2__,5,Y,Books,099082473X,Do Not Resuscitate,What we love and fear about the future.,"Do Not Resuscitate ventures into the life and mind of an elderly man, Jim Frost, at the beginning of the end of his life. It explores the transition from a past lifestyle that we live today into a future of questionable technology that would make skeptics of religious zealots and atheists alike.  Mixed with humor and irony in a very Vonnegut-like fashion, the author writes his main character, Jim Frost, writing his own biography. Meanwhile his daughter Eliza has signed him up to have his brain downloaded onto a microchip to be saved for some future purpose. Ideally, to be downloaded into a new body.  Toying with the idea of living forever due to such technology, Jim frost remembers his own past for the reader and explores what it means to live in die with stories of family issues, friendly encounters, global evolution, mysterious jobs, and present day elderly life. Bouts of light and dark humor jump out from the text in unexpected moments leaving the reader with wry smiles during a variety of emotional moments.  Personally, I found myself brushing through the pages of an easy read that kept the story new and fresh the whole way through. This isn’t to be mistaken for a sci-fi thriller or expansive adventure. It is a book about life and what humans can very well face in the near future. I am a science fiction fan and I love the idea of both near-future and far future stories(Vonnegut, Asimov). I generally like to read science fiction that provides thought-provoking concepts within a variety of time periods; this is one of those stories.  It is an in-depth expedition into life’s big questions. If you enjoy Kurt Vonnegut, you will enjoy this. I recommend."

She looks at obsessive love with a critical and erudite, yet sympathetic eye, never simply pathologizing, but properly deconstructing it in cultural and psychological contexts. She also includes (fairly) recent neurological theory without reducing everything to simplistic, evolutionary psychological cliche.<br /><br />If you're an incurable romantic, you will get much out of this well-written book.

I believe it to be crucially important for students (young & old) to begin music making doing just that - playing as much as possible first without being encumbered too much by reading lots of notation. The CD recording is very good in that it starts students playing using a G tuning thereby allowing music making to be virtually immediate. However, as matters progress to standard tuning, the recording provides notes that are 1/2 flat of concert pitch (Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, Bb, Eb instead of E, A, D, G, B, E)!

Recipes seem to be untested and do not produce the results in the pictures.<br />2  The first part of the book is just a rehash of the excellent book Wheat Belly.  If I had wanted to re-read the Wheat Belly book I would have read it again and not bothered to purchase a ""cook book"" that just rehashes the same thing for a number of chapters.<br />3.  While I really appreciate the author's research, writing and this important health information the cook book was a let down.  There are other cookbooks one can use their common sense and adapt to gluten free, a more thorough explanation on how to do that would have been appreciated more than some non workable recipes with disappointing results for the expense of the ingredients and the time involved.<br />4.  The challenge here is for a great cook to come up with some recipes that taste excellent, are gluten free and actually work.<br /><br />Wheat Belly is worth the price and more, the Wheat Belly Cookbook was a complete waste of money in my opinion.<br /><br />I love cooking and am used to being adaptable in the kitchen with decades of experience.  The first recipe I used, the pancakes with coconut flour was not remotely accurate in terms of flour/liquid proportions.  Following instructions left me with a mixture that could not be made into pancake.  I adapted it with more liquids and had a crumbly waste of expensive ingredients that turned to crumbs when trying to turn them on the grill.  I wondered if this recipe was tested at all.  After that disaster which ended up in the garbage disposal I'm not going to try any more of the recipes that are bread product replacements.<br /><br />While I haven't tried all the recipes my initial attempts have disappointed someone who loves to cook"

20183,20184,__label2__,1,N,Books,802120555,Full Service: My Adventures in Hollywood and the Secret Sex Live of the Stars,Sorry I Purchased This,"I wish I had never purchased this book. Curiosity killed the cat, and now I am guilty of helping this man out financially. At first glance it seemed to be enjoyable and a very easy read.  It won't take the reader long to see how self absorbed this man is.<br /><br />I'm sure that some of this is factual, however it is quite apparent that tooting his own horn is more important than anything an actor or actress can contribute. There are many instances in this book where Mr. Bowers seems to take full credit for the achievement of others. One of the most glaring is when he seems to think if it weren't for him his friend would not have won the Oscar. There are many instances like this through out the book, and it doesn't take someone too long to realize that basically this man is a huge bore.<br /><br />He claims to have no regrets for his life and I believe it.  A long standing marriage to an understanding spouse and the loss of a daughter don't take up too much space in this book.It's all about the pursuit of tail for either himself or all his wonderful &#34;friends&#34; in Hollywood.  Anything of any real importance seems to be thrown in as an after thought.  This is his book and it is all about him.  Stories he relates about his &#34;friends&#34; is pretty much common knowledge to the average reader. Most, if not all of his &#34;friends&#34; are no longer living, so it's his word against theirs.<br /><br />To sum up this book, if you want to call it that, I guess you could say his life is fairly shallow. I'm sure he probably orchestrated hook ups for celebrities in his prime. Okay, he was a pimp. What I find some comfort in is the fact that all his Hollywood &#34;friends&#34; used him  as much as he liked using others. He states many times in the book that what he did for all those years ( pimping), was to make others happy. In his own mind I'm sure he believes this. Every thing he got in this life was on the backs of others.  If these celebrities were really his friends as he emphatically states again and again, he would have kept his mouth closed."

But with the revelations in Paneta's book and the resignation of Hagel from Gates' former position reveal the egomaniacal, micro-manager Obama is as leader.<br />The depth of his commitment to the men and women who serve our country is undeniable, and his desire to see victory in these wars is in contradiction to the President who came into office in 2009. His philosophy was politically-based, with no concern for the service personnel or countries we were deserting. His philosophy was to appease his political constituents and own ideas.<br />Gates presentation painted all participants in a true light, not all flattering or degrading, just personal perception. Clinton comes off well, Biden as incompetent and Obama as an amateur. With movement in the DOD recently, his insights need to be heeded."

I was very disappointed and returned the book for the following reasons...<br /><br />1. The recipes require so much prep! I don't have an hour in the morning to chop veggies, brown meats, etc. I want to just be able to throw stuff into a slow cooker and go.<br />2. I'd say about 75% of the recipes contain spicy peppers. My husband can't tolerate spicy food, so most of the book was pointless for us.<br />3. Most of these recipes also contain nightshades (tomatoes, eggplants, etc.) that, in a Paleo diet, are to be eaten in moderation due to their alkaloid content. Nightshades have been shown to increase inflammation.<br />4.She sure talks about herself a lot. I was curious to learn more about where these recipes came from, but pretty much every page was about Arsy, how she's Armenian, and what Armenians like to eat. Having a few Armenian friends, I understand that this is part of the culture and they are very proud. I really just want to hear about the food, though.<br /><br />Three stars for the beautiful design. It's such a lovely book visually. Also, it seems that she made a real effort to fix the typos in the previous edition."

I usually don't like changes in POV, and often times authors are accused of using this strategy as a cheap ""cop-out"" method when they don't know how to convey feelings of secondary characters.<br />Well, there's no ""cop-out"" here, and book 4 delivers a much-needed break from the formulaic repetitiveness of the first three installments. I was afraid that Mira and Danaus would yet again fly to a far-away destination to prevent the Naturi from wreaking havoc. However, that was not the case here.<br />In Pray for Dawn, Danaus is finally confronted with the being that holds part of his soul. Through various efforts, the bori tries to manipulate Danaus and Mira to set him free, so he can permanently roam the earth.<br />A few of the characters we know make an appearance, but most of the air-time is dedicated to Mira and Danaus.<br />Unfortunately, there were also some inconsistencies, but they can be overlooked.<br />For one, Danaus has several strange encounters with Mira where she acts totally out of character.<br />For example, she calls her car her ""baby"" and she makes several passes at Danaus when you least expect it.<br />Also, some of the plot threads are repeated and some of the interior monologue gets re-hashed to bits.<br />Despite its flaws, Pray for Dawn offers a nice change from the non-stop fighting action of the first three books.<br />Mira and Danaus spent a lot of time together getting to know each other better as she brings him deeper into the world of Nightwalkers."

Difficult to empathize with him.<br /><br />The author does little to give insight into behind-the-scenes of Mason's movies. Mostly one or two sentence mentions that he did this or that.

It might appear to be a children's book, but most definitely not for the younger set.  I found it most entertaining and would highly recommend it."

These are people who are in the right job and contribute positively to the organizations culture.<br /><br />Then multiply that number by the condition of your organizations relationship.  Relationships between employees, between management and labor, between the organization and its customers and suppliers.<br /><br />The perfect number you can have is 1000, but that is probably impossible.  A number of 729 means you are running at full power.  500 to 700 means you are doing pretty well.  Below 500 you need to do some work.<br /><br />That is the premise of the Power Score.  The book is written in a question and answer format, the authors asking the questions they believe the reader would ask and then answering them.  It actually makes for an easy read and makes it easy to explain some of their more complex thoughts.  Overall there is nothing earth shattering in this book, it all comes down to basic common business sense, the authors just organize it in very thoughtful way, and they support all of their claims with references a large pool of research they are pulling from.  They offer ideas and strategies to improve your score in all three of the categories.<br /><br />So I don’t think this book offers any earth shattering ideas, it is full of a lot of good ones.  Worth a read if you are in a position to alter your organization for the better."

We must trust God to not give us anything we can't bear through our understanding that he is always with us.<br /><br />This book has an excellent message, but each chapter has basically the same ideas. In one way, this is valuable because it makes those ideas hit home as you read the book. In another way, the repetition can mean that the reader begins skipping through the book looking for new ideas.<br /><br />I recommend this book if you're searching for your meaning in life and wondering why God sent trials to you. It will give you good ideas for making your life the best it can be by trusting in God and allowing the Holy Spirit into your life.<br /><br />I reviewed this book for PR by the Book."

I feel like he has cast his net too wide with this approach.  He should have just written a book that was for English speakers trying to learn Chinese, as this what he knows best.<br /><br />Anyway, while the book is not perfect, it did encourage me to speak Chinese more and to move out of my comfort zone.

I agree that his consistent message of pushing against the world of petroleum powered vehicles a bit tiresome.  But his practical recommendations for dealing with the issues that confront him in his travels, especially regarding his trike, are quite helpful, and his adventures have a real ring of authenticity that I found particularly interesting.  You really have the feeling that you are there with him as these adventures come up from day to day, so overall, a very worthwhile read, and definitely recommended.

Haven by Kristi Cook was just what I was looking for.<br />After her father is killed, Violet McKenna is presented with the choice of living with her stepmother Patsy in New York, or going to Atlanta with her Grandmother. Afraid that the frail woman could not take on a teenager, Violet finds herself in New York, at the prestigious boarding school- Winterhaven. This move will provide her the opportunity to start fresh, avoid the looks she got at her old school and come into her own. The truth is Violet has always been different. She has told friends and family that she suffered debilitating seizures but that was not the truth. These episodes were a gift she did not want: psychic visions. When Violet is overcome with these visions she is also filled with dread, for they often tell of a violent or dangerous event that will befall someone close to her.<br />The school Winterhaven is beautiful and elite, only accepting those they find are in true need of their services. Violet is not yet aware that the services the school provides are for those with psychic abilities. Her friendships there are composed of honesty and acceptance, and she finds that Winterhaven has also provided her with something more. It is through her ever growing feelings for the mysterious Aiden, that she discovers the truth about herself and this new fantastical world.<br /><br />Haven did contain some elements of Twilight, and though the similarities are there, it rose above the expected and accepted plot line of mortal and immortal. Violet is no normal girl. She contains abilities that she did not want, but by the end of the novel has come to accept and hope to perfect. To me, Haven leans more towards Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Sarah Michelle Gellar version), and empowers young female readers to embrace their differences and be who they are.<br /><br />Paranormal books set in boarding schools always catch my attention and this one did not fail. I would have loved to have gone to a school like Winterhaven (with or without the paranormal). You could watch the friendships unfold between Violet and her roommates and how she befriends the other students at her school. Violet and her friends are just like any other teenager except for their telekinesis, visions and empath abilities. They talk about boys, worry about sports and exams and miss home. The characters are incredibly real. Furthermore, it was impressive how some of the secondary characters were revealed at just the right moment.<br /><br />The pacing, though a bit slow in the beginning, was great for immersing yourself into the story and giving you the time to get to know Violet and her friends and follow Aiden on his personal journey. Just when you think you have a handle on what is going on, Kristi Cook throws something at you that you did not expect! This was a great read and something I will definitely recommend to my friends and students. I cannot wait to read more from Kristi Cook."

It was definitely different and something I would never read again or even recommend.<br /><br />I found myself just waiting for something big to happen and actually get the book going and then I looked down and realized I was two-thirds of the way done and nothing had happened, there was no plot. The main character, David, complained and complained and I wanted to throw the book at him. His girlfriend was equality annoying and the one time I was excited is when she finally discovered her backbone towards the end.<br /><br />Personally, I think it came down to the stylistic choices by the author that I couldn’t get behind. The writing is very spacey and clunky. Most of the story was pure dialogue. I missed the descriptive language and adjectives to make me feel like I’m in the book with the characters. I imagine this could be something you could adjust to but I couldn’t get my head around it, I felt like I was reading someone’s diary instead of a book.<br /><br />In the end it’s a very particular book that wasn’t too my liking, but maybe at 21 I’m just too optimistic about life and growing up to appreciate such “realism.”"
