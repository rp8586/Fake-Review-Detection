I understand that lead has been entering the River Yangtze and East China Sea as a result of poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China (Huh and Chen 1999). Water irrigations systems for farms obtain water from the River Yangtze! As a result the tea plants do get contaminated with lead. Even organic farms in China are at risk. In 2006 Han et al showed that 32% of 1225 tea samples from China contained lead at levels that exceed the maximum permissible concentration. In 2013 Consumer Lab dot com advised people not to consume matcha from China until you are sure about the purity of the matcha! The only way to be sure about the purity of the matcha is to see a lab report on the amount of lead in the matcha. Lead can damage any organ in the body including the brain, causing learning and behavioural problems and also problems with doing arithmetic or language problems.<br />I think it is important that a lab report on lead content of the matcha is uploaded on to Amazon by one organic as it is a matter of food safety. Until then I will not drink this matcha which clearly says on the back of the pack that it is a ""Product of China”. It is an important issue. Once I have seen the lab report on Amazon I will write what I thought about the appearance and taste of this matcha.<br /><br />It is useful to read ""SCALE AND CAUSES OF LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE TEA” and the Consumer Lab dot com article which you can find online.

Some people that purchase weight loss items continue with their unhealthy lifestyle while using the product, but I did not. After losing a close family member to weight related issues last year, I decided to change my life for the better.<br /><br />I purchased the Special K Shakes after hearing great reviews from others online and in my community. I fully trusted their opinions and had high hopes for this product. I purchased it and hoped that within a few weeks, paired with an active lifestyle, that I would notice some sort of results. Two weeks passed, three, four and even six weeks later I hadn't even lost 5 pounds! If you have struggled with weight like I have, you can understand how frustrating this can be. After my experience, I really question the good reviews this product has, I have no idea how people believe this product works in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />So naturally, what did I do? I decided I had to find something else that worked. I wasn't going to let the failure of this product keep me from reaching my goal of losing 50 lbs. I searched and searched, did my due diligence and finally settled on a product that I believed gave me the best chance of reaching my goal.<br /><br />It has been three months and I have lost 42 pounds since giving up on the Special K Shakes and I don't regret it!

I read up on the issue. I found that lead contamination is certainly a big problem with Chinese matcha. Research done in 2006 by Han and his associates at the Key Laboratory of the Ministry Of China called &#34;SCALE AND CAUSES OF LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE TEA&#34; reported that 32% of 1225 samples of Chinese tea exceeded the MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE CONCENTRATION of LEAD!!! It is a real danger that we all should be aware of. Another study has shown that even organic green tea from China contains lead!!!<br /><br />Lead has been entering the River Yangtze which is one of the main rivers in China and the East China Sea due to poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China (Huh and Chen, 1999). I understand that the contaminated water enters agricultural soil in water irrigation systems which obtain water from the river. From the soil, the lead enters the plants and deposits within the leaves. These same leaves are finely powdered to produce Chinese matcha. If you drink tea made from Chinese matcha, there is a definite risk that you are drinking lead with the tea!!!<br /><br />Interestingly, this lead contamination problem does not exist in Japan as Japan has strict industrial waste management regulations and practices. Matcha from Japan is much better. Tests that have been done on matcha from Japan showed that lead in Japanese matcha was &#34;not measurable&#34;<br />Lead can cause disease in any part of the body. Lead can damage the heart, intestines, kidneys, reproductive organs (lead can damage sperm and can damage the developing baby in the womb), nervous system (including the brain) and bones!!!<br /><br />The way to be sure that lead is not present in Chinese matcha is to see a laboratory report on the amount of lead present in the Chinese matcha. In 2013, ConsumerLab.com advised people NOT TO EAT or CONSUME MATCHA from China until they are sure about the purity of the matcha!!!<br /><br />It says in the CUSTOMER QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS section that uVernal told a customer called Barbara Zaretsky that uVernal matcha is made in China. As lead contamination is a big problem in Chinese matcha, I believe that the actual laboratory report should be uploaded on to the Amazon website by the uVernal so that we can all read the results and get some PEACE OF MIND!

Last year ConsumerLab.com (a leading provider of consumer information and independent evaluations of products that affect health and nutrition) said that it is NOT ADVISABLE TO EAT or CONSUME MATCHA from China until you are sure about the purity of the matcha!!! The only way to be sure that lead is not present in Chinese matcha is to see a laboratory report on the amount of lead present in the Chinese matcha. I would like to see the actual laboratory report on lead content of matchaDNA Chinese Matcha. It should be uploaded on to the Amazon website by the matchaDNA so that we can all see the results. Once I see the laboratory report on Amazon, I will decide whether or not to drink this Chinese matcha.<br /><br />I believe that lead has been entering the River Yangtze which is one of the main rivers in China and the East China Sea due to poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China. Subsequently, contaminated water gets into the agricultural soil via water irrigation systems which obtain water from the River Yangtze. From the soil, the lead enters the plants and deposits within the leaves. These same leaves are finely powdered to produce Chinese matcha. If you drink tea made from Chinese matcha, there is a real risk that you are drinking lead with the tea!<br /><br />I was happy to read that this lead contamination problem does not exist in Japan as Japan has strict industrial waste management regulations and practices. Matcha from Japan is better. Tests that have been done on matcha from Japan showed that lead in Japanese matcha was &#34;below the measurable limit&#34; :)<br /><br />The reason why we should all check the amount of lead in Chinese matcha before drinking it is that Lead can cause disease in any part of the body. Lead can damage the BRAIN (causing learning and behavioural problems), heart, intestines, kidneys, reproductive organs (lead can damage sperm and can damage the developing baby in the womb), and the bones!

I just went out and picked up the bar with the highest cocoa content assuming I'd be getting a the highest dose of flavanols (the class of flavanoid that is found in cocoa)... after a little more research though, I realized I'd picked the wrong brand for that. Looking at the ingredients, you'll see that the cocoa is &#34;processed with alkali&#34; (aka Dutch processed chocolate). Apparently, 60-90% of flavanoids are removed during Dutch processing (according to wikipedia). From what I read, you're much better off trying trying to find &#34;natural&#34; chocolate if you are going for the health benefits.  On the other hand... I'm totally addicted to this chocolate! At first I found it too bitter and ate it along with some grapes to help sweeten it up, but after a few nights my palate has changed and am loving it just the way it is. Too bad about the Dutch processing.  If you are going for the healthiest brand regardless of price, it looks like the Xocai brand is the way to go. Not only is it natural, but it's cold pressed (heating the chocolate also removes flavinoids) and is sweetened with açai berries. I couldn't find any data on how big of a difference in flavanoid content of cold pressed and non-cold pressed chocolate, but I doubt it's worth the current cost.  There's a few good dark chocolates available here at amazon that are natural and dairy free with high cocoa content including: Dragoba makes an 87% cocoa organic chocolate bar, and Endangered Species makes one at 88% (Black Panther Extreme Dark Chocolate). Stay away from bars that don't post their ingredients on Amazon (such as Green & Black's organic 85% cocoa dark chocolate bar which contains whole milk).

I was extremely skeptical of these little water-filled baggies of &#34;&#34;fake noodles&#34;&#34;.<br /><br />You should totally check this out:<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00BTMDALO/<br /><br /> I had read horror stories about the fishy odor and rubbery texture. As a low-carb junkie, I REALLY missed the sauces and meals associated with pasta. Enter the Miracle Noodle.<br /><br />Here's what I feel should be addressed:<br /><br />- THE SMELL. Maybe my sinuses are flared up worse than I realize, or maybe I'm at a genetic disadvantage with a lowered sense of smell. But whatever the case, I did NOT find the smell oh-so-offensive as others have described. I actually braced myself as I cut the pouch open the first time -- ready for the worst -- but I didn't smell anything until I literally put my nose an inch above the open bag. And I'd describe the smell as more of a &#34;&#34;brine&#34;&#34; than a &#34;&#34;fish&#34;&#34; odor. C'mon guys, it's not bad.<br /><br />- THE TEXTURE. I've found that the texture varies greatly on the preparation of the noodles. My first time eating them, I was rushed and starving... so I ate them straight out of the microwave tossed in pesto sauce. Not so great -- they were definitely rubbery this time. BUUUT, the SECOND time I prepared them, I made a creamy based sauce (melted 1 oz. cream cheese, 1 Tbs heavy cream, and 2 tsp. coconut oil, topped with some curry powder) and LET IT SIT for 2-3 minutes after preparing the dish. This way the sauce reeeally soaked into the noodles and gave them a softer and less-rubbery texture. Oh, and I just nuked them in the microwave this time, too. THIS time was good. Definitely a more &#34;&#34;noodle-like&#34;&#34; texture. I ate every last noodle!<br /><br />Also, some tips I've read are to microwave the noodles twice PRIOR to preparing them. By this, I mean: Open bag, rinse in warm water, microwave 2 minutes, rinse again, microwave for another 2 minutes, rinse one last time. At thispoint they're ready to prepare as desired.<br /><br />I'm pleased with my purchase, and I'd recommend these to people watching their glucose levels or anybody wanting a zero-carb option.",679,565,42.0

Not as firm or brightly colored, but SO much better for you!","We stopped eating Jello years ago, because of the toxic dyes, fake flavoring and other crap ingredients.  I (ok, my daughter) spotted this Bakol Jel Strawberry dessert in the grocery store last week (about $3.50 a package) and was very happy to see this cleaner, non gmo version.  It's made with 100% natural ingredients, non gmo, gluten free, and certified vegan.  It is not as vibrant as usual Jello, but so what.  It's so much better for you, so try to deal with it.  We tried making the Jel in our old Jello molds, and it actually came out ok, not as firm as jello but it still held its shape.  However, it is more watery, so when making it, I decrease the water it calls for a bit.  Also, if you let the set Jel warm to room temperature, it becomes very runny.  The taste is good though, very strawberry, but not in the intense, fake and artificial way.  If you are expecting something exactly like Jello, you will be disappointed.  If you have been searching for a cleaner alternative to jello, give this Bakol Jel a chance. We are happy to have found it, because the kids can finally have (occasionally) their gelatin dessert. The ingredients are: evaporated cane juice, vegetable gum, citric acid, potassium citrate, natural flavor, beet powder. I apologize for taking a picture of it on an orange plate, it's hard to see the color (which is a pale pink).

Why this is called a steak sauce, is the question of the day. It tastes like a brown brisket (not the red corned beef brisket) gravy made from boiled down beef brisket meat juice, along with the strained carrots, celery and onions. The next time I cook a brisket and run out of gravy, I can always use Andria's instead. Andria's is not a steak sauce, it is a brisket style gravy, with added soy sauce. The label mentions marinating a steak in it, and brushing it on a steak during cooking. Maybe I will use it if I overcook a steak until it is dry and brown inside like a brisket, -otherwise, no thank you. Andria's is also a bit salty, and contains 400 mg of salt per tablespoon, about what you would get in a hotdog, and hotdogs are considered salty to begin with. People with high blood pressure and on a low salt diet may want to avoid this sauce altogether. Andria's also contains soybeans, giving it a bit of a soy sauce flavor. It might be suitable for use on Chinese food in place of regular soy sauce, but not for use on a steak. As far as I am concerned, this is fifteen ounces of expensive gravy or soy sauce. Be careful when pouring, as the bottle does not have a soy sauce shaker top, and you can easily dump it out all at once. The Nutrition Facts and INGREDIENTS as listed on the label are as follows:  Nutrition Facts: Serving Size 1 tbsp (15 g), Servings per container 30. Amount Per Serving: Calories 10 (Calories from fat 0), Total Fat 0 g (Saturated Fat 0 g, Trans Fat 0 g), Sodium 400 mg, Total Carbohydrate 2 g (Sugars 1 g), Protein 0 g.

Their spelling mistake, not mine). Allergens: Contains Soybeans, Wheat, Dextrose.  The EXP date is stamped in black on the top of the white bottle cap.  If you walk down the supermarket aisle, and you see the label &#34;ANDRIA'S BRUSH-ON STEAK SAUCE&#34;, you naturally think that it is what it says it is, a steak sauce. You won't notice the fine print on the back label until you get home. I will type the label information exactly as it is on the back label: &#34;AFTER OPENING STIR WELL KEEP REFRIGERATED For Charcoal Broiling or Oven Broiling, Baking, or Grilling. Also add to Ground Meats, Stews, and Gravies. Can be Used as a Microwave Browning Agent. BRUSH-ON Before and During Cooking Beef, Chops, Hamburger, Roasts, Meat loafs, Etc. Also Excels as a Marinade.&#34;  It may be a matter of definitions, but in my best attempt to decipher the purpose of this sauce, it is a marinade that you put on meat prior to cooking, and it can also be used as a basting &#34;Browning Agent&#34; during cooking to keep the meat from drying out. It also mentions adding it to gravies, which makes sense, as this sauce tastes like a gravy already. If this sauce is really meant for cooking, it should not, I repeat, not, mention steak sauce on the front label. A steak sauce is something that you put on your steak after it is cooked and placed on your plate, regardless of whether you choose to brush it on or pour it on. I hope that this note has helped folks to clear up any confusion that they might have as to what ANDRIA'S BRUSH-ON STEAK SAUCE really is. Purist human carnivores even prefer making do with a little salt and black pepper on their steak. Myself, I prefer adding a steak sauce, and this Andria's sauce is definitely not a steak sauce.

Instead, they just add some nice additional taste to the corn.

While it should be noted that Aunt Jemima doesn't really have the best waffles on the market (for some reason they're really chewy and tougher compared to the superior cheaper store brand ones- go figure!) an even bigger issue is that 64 ounces of maple syrup isn't even necessary for someone like me who lives alone.

Then again this stuff *does* tend to last a really long time in the cabinet doesn't it?  Many months!  That's pretty dependable.    However clearly 64 ounces of maple syrup is more appropriate for a family of 4 or more who eats pancakes and waffles regularly every morning.  Only appropriate for those families and not for people like me!  I'll just settle with the smaller jugs.  It's not like I use a lot of syrup anyway.  I never understood the fascination dumping as much syrup as you possibly can on your breakfast food.

In the tea house I went to in Kyoto there was a tea class that explained how to properly prepare matcha. If you are looking for tea to create an authentic ceremony then I would highly recommend this tea. When I prepared this tea it brought me back to the tea house in Kyoto. I would prepare this tea for guests, exchange students, conducting a ceremony, and when teaching about Japanese culture.<br /><br />At Japanese tea ceremonies the most important thing is the green tea. Ceremonial tea grade matcha is the highest quality powdered green tea. When you open the container you can see and smell the quality. When I opened this package I could tell that the matcha was great quality. The smell wasn't bitter, but lightly sweet, and it smelled like grass. The power is fine, soft, and pure green. It did not stick to the package sides and slide easily out into the cup. The taste is a mixture of slightly bitter and similar to barley. It also has a unique flavor itself that I can only describe as matcha itself.<br /><br />When you make green tea from powder you need to consider how to make it properly. A cup that is shaped like a bowl is appropriate for traditional ceremonies, and you would need a bamboo whisk to stir the powder and water. It should froth at the top while you whisk, and after you whisk. If you like stronger tea then the entire pouch is good for one cup, but if you don't like strong tea then only use half of it. The water shouldn't be boiling hot, but just before the boiling point. If it is too hot it will take away from the flavor, and if it is too cold it will be extremely bitter and clump together. If you're just drinking this in a regular mug you should be cautious with how strong you are making the matcha, and stir it with a regular utensil. Make sure to stir thoroughly so that you don't leave any clumps in the cup.<br /><br />When drinking this tea you should finish it in one sitting. If you let the tea become cold it will increase in bitterness and become unpleasant. It is rude to not finish a cup of tea during a traditional ceremony, and the last sip should be a long one. If you haven't attended a ceremony but want to prepare one I suggest watching a video first because there are many steps to making the perfect cup of tea. The cup, whisk, scooper, kettle, and tea can make the difference in preparation for a ceremony. With this tea it is important to have the other components be top quality to enjoy the tea at its best.<br /><br />This grade of tea doesn't need anything added but water. You shouldn't add sugar to this tea, or lemon, or anything else. If you think it is too bitter then you should eat sweets while drinking it. Youkan is the traditional Japanese bean paste sweet to have with matcha. The sweets will curve the bitterness and make the experience more enjoyable.<br /><br />If you are wanting to make green tea ice cream I suggest staying with this brand, but consider using a lower grade of tea. It still works with ceremonial grade, but it seems like a waste to use such high quality tea for something else. Adding some powder on top of vanilla ice cream tastes amazing. There are more uses for green tea than just drinking it, though with this grade of green tea the best way is to drink it.",678,461,7.0

This is stating the obvious, of course, but they contain peanut and tree nut (almond oil) ingredients.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, one serving is an ounce, which contains 120 calories (35 from fat). One serving has 0.5 grams of saturated fat but no cholesterol. One serving has 35 mg of sodium and 20 g of carbohydrates (very little fiber and about 10g of sugar). Finally, these have 3g of protein per serving and a tiny amount (about 2%) of iron. If I haven't mentioned something else that is commonly included on the nutrition part of the label, that's because it isn't in this product (i.e., no vitamin C).<br /><br />Texture-wise, these are very similar to the hard/crunchy kind of granola bars. These are broken into pieces maybe 1/2 inch square (not quite 1/2 inch thick). You do see big, whole peanut halves in these. I mostly notice the peanut flavor; the quinoa doesn't add much flavor and the ginger is more of a mild undertone (it's there, but not overpowering).<br /><br />Maybe it's because I haven't let myself eat too many snack foods lately or maybe not, but I think these things are delicious.

Frankly, I was delightfully surprised by how flavorful it is.<br /><br />To the folks whose reviews claim that this is mis-labeled hummus instead of baba ghanouj - I disagree. Perhaps the confusion comes from the denser consistency of this product. If you follow the directions by adding some olive oil and lemon and thoroughly mixing it in, then the consistency will be that of a well made baba ghanouj. The directions also call for mixing in crushed garlic, which is essential to achieve an authentic flavor. I believe those ingredients were left out of the can and left to the buyer to increase shelf life.<br /><br />After mixing in the lemon juice, olive oil and crushed garlic I also add a pinch of cumin into the mix. Right before serving I will sometimes sprinkle cumin or summac over the top for an added flavor as well as drizzle more olive oil over the top of the baba ghanouj in the serving dish or bowl.<br /><br />There are a few nutritional facts you should take into account: there are about ten servings in a can, and each one contains 180mg of sodium. If you are on a low sodium diet you need to be careful of how much you consume. Also each serving contains 2.5 grams of fat of which a half gram is saturated. This is BEFORE you add olive oil, which will raise the fat content per serving by another 14 grams of fat per tablespoon of oil used when you mix the baba ghanouj. Each of the ten servings is 40 calories before adding in the olive oil, which contains an additional 140 calories per tablespoon.<br /><br />While the above nutritional facts look dismal, bear in mind that they are about par for any properly prepared baba ghanouj - although you can control the sodium content by making this dish from scratch. Although my diet is restrictive I can break the rules occasionally when I want baba ghanouj but am too lazy to make it myself. Used in moderation this is an excellent alternative and one that is authentic if you follow the directions and mix in the missing ingredients and garnish to taste. And it's an inexpensive alternative as well as a convenient one.",682,658,189.0

With Cherryheads, you get a nice flavor of tart cherries, especially if you chew on them (which I recommend :-).<br /><br />When I was growing up in the Chicagoland area, Ferrara Pan candies were a staple of every kids diet.

And thanks to my discovery this year, I can add Hershey's Kisses - Pumpkin Spice to the list.<br /><br />The orange and brown striped wrapper looks just like a normal kiss, and the shape is the same as well.  You’d certainly never know that these are something different – until you unwrap them.  Inside the foil, you’ll find an orange covered kiss.  If you bite into it, you’ll discover a small white chocolate core, but most of the candy is made up of the orangey outside layer.<br /><br />And that’s a good thing.  These kisses don’t take much like chocolate but then again white chocolate rarely does.  Instead, they taste just like perfectly spiced pumpkin, and the white chocolate adds a touch of sweetness while letting the pumpkin spice flavor take center stage.  I can pop one in my mouth and taste the delicious cookies or muffins I’ve had in the past.  They melt in your mouth fairly easily, although I find it hard to wait long enough for them to melt.  I’m chewing and swallowing while unwrapping the next one.<br /><br />Which isn’t necessarily a good thing since these kisses aren’t good for you.  9 of these guys have 210 calories, 110 of them from fat.

The drink was so sweet it was undrinkable. So I dumped the whole thing into a 24 oz tumbler and added another 12 oz of coffee. It went from awful to the best coconut coffee I have ever had.<br /><br />I absolutely love blackberry so was thrilled when I saw this company makes a blackberry syrup. After reading the other review I almost didn't get it. But I remembered my first use with the other flavor and decided to give it a shot. I am SO glad I did! When I first opened the bottle I tried I tiny drop of the syrup straight and it was very strong. Previous review said it was almost medicinal and I will agree with that assessment...but only until you use it as it was intended. We made Italian sodas and used a single pump per soda (other brands need 3-5 pumps).  My husband said it was the best berry flavored soda he's had and I have to agree.<br /><br />You cannot compare this product with Torani syrups unless you use it in the correct amounts. A serving size of Torani is 1 oz. A serving of Amoretti is 1 pump (pump is included)! Same sized bottles give you drastically different cost per servings. A 25.4 oz bottle of this syrup is 94 servings vs Torani's 25. It also means you are about only half the calories (this is also determined by the flavors you select) and, in my opinion, a truer flavor...and last I checked Torani was a couple dollars a bottle more. (Though Amoretti's flavor is worth a higher price...I love that they are cheaper!)<br /><br />This is definitely our new ""go-to"" brand for flavored syrups!",682,654,196.0

Because of the dual language, Amazon is calling it  Morton Pimienta Season-All.  Anyway, here is my review from a couple of years ago.<br /><br />I had been using this Pepper Season-All (under the McCormick label, UPC 052100071336, 5.75 oz.) for many, many years, mostly as my secret ingredient for marinades. Not anymore.<br /><br />About 2 and a half years ago, McCormick sold its Season-All line to Morton, the Pepper Season-All having a UPC of 024600017558, for the 5.75 oz. plastic jar. As I was on my last jar, but hadn't seen the McCormick product in any stores for sometime, I contacted McCormick and they told me Season-All was now under the Morton label. I looked in every grocery I stopped at between Seattle and Spokane and could not find this product anywhere. I asked manager after manager if they were going to get any in, but they checked and said no. I had that UPC memorized, much to their surprise. Go figure.<br /><br />Then, one day at a Wal-Mart, I found it in their spice section and bought the 3 jars they had left. I believe I paid $2.38 per jar. That was the first and ONLY time I have seen it in a store ANYWHERE. When I asked a manager at the same Wal-Mart when they were getting another shipment in, he said he didn't know, as it was out of his control. I asked if I could request they special order it, but he said no. So much for that.<br /><br />It was available on the Morton website (and still is), and even though a 2-pack is reasonable at $7.58, shipping costs are ridiculous. They want $10.44 for FedEx Home delivery (6-10 business days) and $23.12 for FedEx 2nd Day delivery, which shows as arriving in 3 -7 business days. Crazy!<br /><br />Now on Amazon, there a re a few ordering options, but this one takes the cake. $16.99 for a single 5.75.oz. jar, but free Prime Shipping, which I have. Or, even worse, a 6-pack for $89.99 (Free Prime Shipping) or $79.99 ($19.99 Shipping). The latter 2 are actually cheaper overall than the one for $16.99, but you get the picture.<br /><br />What the heck are these guys smoking?<br /><br />UPDATE: Now on Amazon reasonably priced (6-pack) with Prime Shipping!<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Morton-Pimienta-Season-All-Seasoned-5-75-Ounce/dp/B00473QU5U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1360896118&sr=8-1&keywords=Morton+Pepper+Season-All<br /><br />In my search for alternative, I found something that works, but you also need to add course-ground black pepper. McCormick's new Perfect Pinch. It has Roasted Garlic and Red Bell Peppers, no MSG and seems to work well.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you find any Pepper Season-All in a store, buy it and try it, you won't be dissappointed!",677,475,9.0

It's great being able to use my own choice in my Vue machine when I want.<br /><br />I was a little hesitant at first considering a friend of mine had tried similar items for his Platinum Keurig brewer and said the coffee always seemed weak. Thankfully that is not the case here (there is always the strong option on the Vue brewer if you need it even stronger).<br /><br />As of writing this review I believe this is the only product out there that fulfills this function for the Vue brewer. Luckily this item is quality built and designed very well. Their customer service responds quickly and was very helpful regarding my inquiries. The piano hinge is very strong and the plastic the cup is made of is thick, so I believe it will last a long time. The cup and filter are easy to clean, although at a while the file does start to darken with coffee oils, although they informed me that this can be easily taken care of with distilled white vinegar and a soft toothbrush. The decaflow head does distribute water evenly. This item also works well with loose leaf tea and I have used tea bags with great success as well.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that you must make sure the lid is compressed as possible, and must be careful when closing and opening the Vue machine. The cup can and will slide, which if not careful when will damage the needle due to the cup sliding out into the needles path. I'm not sure if they could have designed a solution to this problem due the design of the machine's horizontal brewing style.<br /><br />UPDATE July 9th, 2013: After attempting to clean off some of the coffee that stains/builds up on the gold screen after a while following the instructions I received after making an inquiry (see review above) some of the gold plating has come off. I was extremely gentle with the soft toothbrush after letting it soak in distilled white vinegar overnight.

Coffee Beans are to be enjoyed when they are fresh roasted.  They are a perishable product that can go stale.    I have been subscribing to this product, and have often being sent older stored roasted date beans.  Fresh roasted coffee beans reach their ""peak"" at about 2 weeks after roasting, and diminish from there.  My last shipment was 3 month old beans under my 'Subscribe and Save'.  The original beans are quite good, but no longer being 'fresh roasted' by the time I receive them was disappointing   I had to discontinue the Subscribe and Save as a result of this...    How to read a Coffee Bean Direct Date Code at the bottom of 5lb bag:  First off, the ""Expiration Date"" is exactly 1 year from the Roast/Packing Date.    Second, the date code is written as such: (example) ""26714.02 ""  EQUALS ""267""th day of year (20)""14"" . batch ""02"".  267th day of year is Sept 24th; 14 is year 2014; .02 is 2nd batch of day....    Being sent 3 month old beans is the fault of warehouse inventory control.  I believe the vendor does freshly pack his beans, and sends to Amazon warehouse.  Then Amazon stockpiles it into warehouse storage, and ships out older stockpiles...  I really want freshest roast date product, so I have to again change vendor sources...    **** Original Review***  I have been using Malabar Monsooned beans for about 8 Years, and I am glad to have this new source to choose from.  I feel that monsooned malabar is optimal for Cappuccinos, as its smoothness complements micro-foamed milk quite well.  My first pull from this new order had a very nice crema, dark golden colored as hoped for and expected. Smooth and rich.  City Roasted, roasted till the first crack and allowed to rest before finishing, had the characteristics I wanted, not too darkly roasted...  So for people who want to grind their beans via a burr grinder, and pull a golden shot via their dialed in espresso machine, I can recommend this.  I don't use this for drip coffee, so I can't comment on that, but this makes a pretty good cappuccino via my Gaggia Classic.  4.25 Stars",682,619,64.0

After adding cinnamon to my diet to reduce blood sugar (which it did dramatically), in June 2013 my AST was 127.  Since I am on niaspan and livalo, my doctor suspected they may have caused the elevated readings.<br />I just randomly happened upon nutritionfacts.org after that office visit, and browsing through articles, noticed<br />[...]  Here's a partial transcript:  The use of cinnamon to help treat diabetes remains controversial. We know that cinnamon is so good at controlling one's blood sugar that you can cheat on a diabetes test by consuming 2 teaspoons of cinnamon the night before your glucose tolerance test. Basically they make you drink some sugar water and see how well your body can keep your blood sugar levels under control, and if you eat those two teaspoons right when the test starts or 12 hours before you can significantly blunt the spike. A half teaspoon doesn't seem to be enough… but about a teaspoon a day appears to make a significant difference. A review of the best studies done to date found that the intake of cinnamon by type 2 diabetics or prediabetics does lower their blood glucose significantly. So what's the controversy? Cassia cinnamon, also known as chinese cinnamon, or probably what you're getting at the store if it just says cinnamon contains a compound called coumarin which may be toxic to the liver in high enough doses.  For little kids, just a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon a few times a week may be too much, and a teaspoon a day of cassia cinnamon might be too much for anyone. Nearly all of the studies showing blood sugar benefits of cinnamon have been done on cassia. Research shows blunting of blood sugars in response to cassia cinnamon, but in response to Ceylon cinnamon, nothing.<br />Google Korintje liver to see lots of warnings, but you will not see any on the product description here, or on general nutrition advice websites, or from dieticians and (most) doctors., or from dieticians and (most) doctors.",681,615,67.0
